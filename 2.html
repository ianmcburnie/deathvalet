<p class="sceneheading" id="gx5ssg30">PROLOGUE - Diner<br>
</p>
<p id="BkHhCbf0" class="shot">A small roadside diner, nestled amongst tall,
ancient redwood trees. The parking lot out front is illuminated only by the
fluorescent light coming from within. A battered old estate car and two
pristine, heavy goods vehicles sit in the lot. The pale moon is blanketed by
dark, ominous clouds. Where there are gaps between trees there is only the
darkness of the night.<br>
</p>
<p id="gMhCuv30" class="shot">A tired looking sign above the entrance reads:
"Diner". A wild dog, or maybe it's a wolf or coyote, scavenges for food scraps
around the large metal bins.<br>
</p>
<p id="to4jide0" class="sceneheading">PROLOGUE - Jukebox<br>
</p>
<p id="jJEhm800" class="shot">Inside, business is slow. Two children (1st
graders) push quarters into the coin slot of a large, cabinet-sized jukebox. A
waitress carries a pot of coffee towards two flannel shirted men sat at the bar.<br>
</p>
<p id="K1Kjih80" class="shot">The two young children, boy and girl, push their
noses against the glass of the jukebox.<br>
</p>
<p id="wiNjQ830" class="shot">Inside the jukebox, a mechanical arm retrieves a
small vinyl disc. The disc is but one of hundreds, lined up neatly along an
interior shelf.</p>
<p id="0G5j8i20" class="shot">The disc is lowered onto the revolving turntable.<br>
</p>
<p id="Ii3j5Md0" class="shot">The disc spins and wobbles.<br>
</p>
<p id="e35jkh10" class="shot">The needle falls into place with a soft thud
followed by a warm, soothing crackle.</p>
<p id="8NLjMq40" class="sceneheading">PROLOGUE - Waitress<br>
</p>
<p id="g2Fv1980" class="shot">The waitress pours coffee into the mugs of the
two truckers. Her name badge reads "Jean". A small tower of blond hair sits
neatly atop her head, held together by a clasp.<br>
</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight?&nbsp;Are
you sorry we drifted apart?<br>
</p>
<p id="wM5jJ3a0" class="shot">The bearded truckers seem oblivious of each
other, and stare blankly at the TV raised high up on the wall above the
sparsely-stocked bar.<br>
</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day? When I kissed
you and called you sweetheart?</p>
<p id="Np9j3Ad0" class="shot">CNN is broadcasting live coverage of the Gulf
War. SCUD missiles soar across the Iraqi desert.</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? Do you gaze
at your doorstep and picture me there?<br>
</p>
<p id="kILj1h30" class="shot">As the waitress walks away, fixing a stray blond
hair as she goes, the truckers swivel their heads to admire her shapely figure.</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Is your heart filled with pain?<br>
</p>
<p id="9hIh0b80" class="shot">She now sits in a table booth by the window,
loose hair firmly back in place. Pages of financial accounts lie scattered
across the table. Pencil, notepad and calculator are close at hand. The front
of the notebook is engraved in small letters with the name "Kathy". She seems
to consider opening it for a second.<br>
</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Shall I come back again?</p>
<p id="j3zpu420" class="shot">She now looks wistfully out of the window, but
sees nothing but her own, glum reflection.</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX</p>
<p class="dialog">Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?</p>
<p class="sceneheading" id="gOd9bza0">PROLOGUE - Highway</p>

</p>
<p class="caption">I wonder if you're lonesome tonight...<br>
</p>
<p id="B88jga80" class="shot">A battered, flatbed truck careers wildly along
the highway, its headlights on full beam.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must
play a part...</p>
<p id="pc8jB700" class="shot">The truck overtakes a car at high speed on a
narrow bend. The driver of the car has to swerve dangerously towards the side
of the road, sounding his horn and raising his fist in annoyance at the
reckless truck driver. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="caption">Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart...</p>
<p id="AEuSyCzcJ80x" class="shot">Inside the truck, the driver pays no heed to
the irate motorist. This man's face is filled with his own silent rage. His
bleary eyes strain to focus on the white lines of the road ahead.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance...</p>
<p id="JazpoA40" class="shot">He takes a long swig from a liquor bottle.<br>
</p>
<p id="g2FvDa80" class="sceneheading">PROLOGUE - Polaroid<br>
</p>
<p id="g2Fvo980" class="shot">Closeup of truck driver's free hand on the wheel.
On the dashboard is a photograph of a strikingly beautiful woman. Her face
angelic and coy and surrounded by locks of glorious blond hair.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue...</p>
<p id="M3zpuna0" class="shot">Closeup of his face - still strained and
tormented as before. His eyes now fixed downwards on the photograph.</p>
<p class="caption">Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange...</p>
<p id="g2Fvqa80" class="shot">He now holds both the whiskey and the photograph
in his left hand, perilously close to the open driver side window.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">And why? I've never known...</p>
<p id="g2Fvca80" class="shot">From outside we see the photograph being tossed
out of the window. The wind eagerly snatches it away and up into the night.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">Honey, you lied when you said you loved me...</p>
<p id="g2Fvda80" class="shot">The truck careers wildly on down the highway,
becomes a speck in the distance, as the photograph continues its wild, airborne
dance. In a lay-by sits a parked highway patrol car, its exterior lights off.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">And I had no cause to doubt you...</p>
<p class="sceneheading" id="C2d9qge0">PROLOGUE - Kamikaze</p>
<p id="g2Fv2a80" class="shot">The waitress sits in the booth by the window with
her accounts, pencil and calculator in hand. She&nbsp;rubs her forehead in
consternation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness
all around...</p>
<p id="g2Fvva80" class="shot">One of the old truckers becomes agitated, and
points in the direction of the window.</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">And if you won't come back to me...</p>
<p id="g2Fv4a80" class="shot">The waitress looks up, she has to shield her eyes
with her hands from the sudden glare of headlights from outside.</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Then they can bring the curtain down.</p>
<p id="g2Fv5b80" class="shot">Her face is now a picture of almost quizzical
terror as she stumbles backwards away from the window. Behind her, still by the
jukebox, the children remain rooted to the spot.</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?</p>
<p id="ljfj2H70" class="shot">The driver is now hunched over the wheel, his
eyes&nbsp;narrow and bleary.<br>
</p>
<p class="character">JUKEBOX<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?</p>

of the road.<br>

rifle - as if about to take aim at something in the direction of the pointed
telescope. Matthias has closely-cropped dark hair
and a light goatee beard. His hairline is receding. His eyes are dull

anywhere between late twenties and early forties.<br>

his torch over to one side, towards the camera. We see him from the waist up,
side on. Darkness behind him. His face more concerned now.</p>

object lurking in the foreground. This time Martin is much closer and his
flashlight points straight towards the mysterious object.</p>

<p id="h2Fv5H80" class="shot">Martin's hand grips and tug at the edge of the
tarpaulin, partially revealing a large metal box of some kind.</p>

</p>
<p id="h2Fv2H80" class="shot">The tarpaulin lands in a heap by the side of
object. We see still do not see the object in full. Martin looks down at the
object, his face full of distant, somber emotion.</p>

<p id="Jie7i790" class="shot">Martin stands in front of an old metal jukebox.
It is blackened with fire damage and the glass is shattered.<br>
</p>
<p id="MLe72sd0" class="shot">Another thud comes from the jukebox. But Martin
stands rooted to the spot, as if locked in a trance.<br>

<p id="h2e7bad0" class="shot">Inside the jukebox, resting on the remains of the

inside. Something inside, a white piece of paper maybe, catches his attention.<br>
</p>
<p id="11zCg240" class="shot">Then a flutter of wings and feathers, a raven
emerges from the dark hole, squawking loudly. It flies directly at Martin,
forcing him to duck out of the way.<br>

the old machine, and holds his hand up to his face to inspect his find. A small
white envelope.<br>

<p id="AtzC7B80" class="shot">Martin rises from his knees, and leans over the
machine. A puzzled expression on his face.</p>
<p id="OvzCbe40" class="shot">View from behind Martin as he still stands,
leaning forward against the jukebox. The apparition of a young girl stands
beside him. Her form is ethereal and ghost-like.<br>

<p id="j5zCG710" class="shot">We see the two figures standing side-by-side,
pressed against a now pristine and reconstructed jukebox.<br>
