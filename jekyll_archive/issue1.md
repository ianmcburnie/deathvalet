1. INTRO - Valet

    1. A modest, single-story casino lies nestled among the huge, redwood trees of an old mountain highway. The neon lights read "Tommy's Casino".

        > "The family you came from isn't as important as the family you're going to..."

    1. A silver Mercedes approaches the main driveway of the casino. Behind the tint of the windows, the driver's features remain indistinguishable.

        > "...at least, that's what somebody once told me."

    1. We see Martin, a young valet attendant standing outside the Casino entrance. He is smartly dressed in charcoal trousers, black shoes, burgundy waistcoat and white shirt. He is around 5,10". His short dark hair is swept back and to one side, framing his youthful, handsome face. A name badge is pinned to his breast pocket. A small desk/podium stands beside him. Littered about it's surface are papers, business cards and a clunky looking cell phone.

        > "My uncle put me to work at the valet as soon as I was old enough to drive."

    1. View from inside the silver car pulling up to attendant. We only see the driver's hands on the wheel. His pudgy fingers are adorned with large, ugly rings. A sign by the curb reads 'Valet Parking'.

        > "I've always loved cars."

    1. The driver, Dick, has stepped out of the car and is passing the keys to the young attendant. The car door remains open. Dick is portly, and has a wheezing red-face. Somewhere around 50 years old. He wears western, cowboy style attire that is one size too small for him. Cream trousers and a cream shirt. Brown sweat stains. The man oozes sleaze.

        > "I've had a fascination with them ever since I was a young boy."

        - DICK
            - Take good care of it boy

    1. Closeup of Martin's hand taking the key. The key loop placed over one finger. The key is in the shape of a naked lady. We see the boy's name badge, it reads 'MARTIN'.

        > "Some would even say a morbid fascination."

    1. Dick walks through the automatic double doors of the casino entrance. Behind him is the roar of the car engine.

        > "Everyone in town knew what my father had done."

        - SFX
            - Vrrrrrrroooooooooom!

    1. Dick stops and turns around, his face flustered and angry. The car screeches off.

        > "And how his brother, my uncle, stepped in and raised me as his own."

        - DICK _under his breath_
            - That little bastard

1. INTRO - Garage

    1. The silver car is at a parking garage gate. Martin's hand reaches out of the driver side window, taking a ticket from the machine.

        > "He gave me a roof over my head."

    1. The gate rises and the car accelerates into the large indoor parking garage ahead.

        > "He gave me a *big* roof over my head."

    1. The silver car accelerates down the straight section. There are cars parked on either side.

        > "With all the cars I ever wanted."

        - SFX
            - Vrrrrrrrrrroooooom

    1. The silver car brakes sharply, it's tires screeching on the polished surface. We see an up ramp to the roof level, the twinkling stars visible above, and a down ramp, with only darkness below.

        > "I have a rooftop balcony, where I sit and watch the stars at night."

        - SFX
            - Screeeeeech!

    1. The silver car turns sharply to take the down ramp, wheels squeaking loudly again.

        > "But best of all, I have my own basement."

    1. View from bottom of down-ramp as the large, silver car descends the steep incline. The bright glare of the headlights drowns us in light.

        > "It's all a kid ever wanted."

    1. There are no overhead lights on in the basement, so we see very little. There don't appear to be any other valet cars parked here. The silver car rolls along slowly.

        > "Nobody ever disturbs me down here."

    1. We now see an illuminated corner of the parking garage. There is a collection of cars and bikes and other assorted machinery. They look like they have been worked on by a mechanic. Some have doors missing, or their engines stripped. Others are jacked up without wheels.

        > "I mostly have the place to myself."

    1. As the car slows to a halt, we see a closeup of the spinning gyration of the hub cap. It's polished silver surface seems to reflect the hazy form of a young child standing by the car.

        > "Mostly..."

1. INTRO - Breaks

    1. View of a spinning roulette wheel.

    1. The wheels stops, the ball nestles in the number 6. The people at the table cheer loudly, and hug each other.

        > "I'm too young to work in the casino."

        - CROWD
            - Woooooooo! Yeeeeee-har!

    1. At a nearby blackjack table, Dick is surveying his two cards. We see a ten and a six. Dick's face is a look of disgust. He is a little drunk. A large tumbler of tequila sits on the table by his left hand. The dealer waits patiently.

        > "Too young too gamble. Too young to drink."

        - DICK _to nobody in particular_
            - Sixteen? What the hell is this?

    1. Closeup of Dick rapping his knuckles on the table, signaling the dealer for another twist of the cards.

        > "The place is full of addicts, crooks, perverts, you name it."

        - DICK
            - Hit me. C'mon. Hit me you fuck.
        - DEALER
            - Ahem. Yes, of course, sir.

    1. The dealer turns another card. It's the Queen of Diamonds. The dealer looks embarrassed and tries to steer Dick away from losing more money, but Dick loses his temper further.

        > "Any kind of degenerate you could imagine, they were right here. My uncle would roll out the mat."

        - DEALER
            - Not your night, sir. Why don't you take a break?
        - DICK
            - A break!? I'll break your god damn...

1. INTRO - Queen

    1. A woman slides up to the table and seats herself by Dick, diffusing the situation. Her face is heavy with makeup. She wears a slender, high-neckline black cocktail dress. A string of diamonds lie across her neck. Her hair is shoulder-length and blond.

        > "They became my extended family."

        - CATHERINE
            - May I join you...?
        - DICK
            Huh?

    1. Catherine seats herself beside Dick. Dick looks her up and down, approvingly.

        > "But nobody gets to choose their own family, do they?"

        - CATHERINE
            - Let's see if *this* Queen of Diamonds brings you some luck.
        - DICK
            - Luck? You already brought me luck. It's my lucky night!

    1. Dick signals for the waitress' attention. High up on the wall, a digital clock face reads 10:06PM.

        > "Dick was the casino PR man. He'd take photos, arrange PR stunts, that kind of thing."

        - DICK
            - Hey you! Drinks!

    1. Dick swivels in his chair, teetering slightly.

        > "Everyone knew he was a pervert and a voyeur."

        - DICK
            - Now my dear, what did you say your name was?

1. INTRO - Devil in Disguise

    1. Inside the parking garage. It's dark. We see Dick's silver car looming in the foreground. Dick and Catherine stumble arm-in-arm through the garage in the background. Dick has had too much to drink and Catherine supports his weight with apparent ease.

        > "So it wasn't too difficult for Catherine to get him right where she wanted."

        - DICK _belches loudly_
            - Where the hell are we going? I can't see a thing.
        - CATHERINE
            - I want to see your car. Your big shiny car.

    1. Catherine unlocks the car.

        > "The fat sleaze-ball was practically on a leash."

        - DICK
            - We shouldn't be down here. That little freak will catch us.

    1. Closeup of Catherine's face. Her left eye and cheek twitching slightly.

        - DICK
            - Hey, how did you get my key?

    1. Catherine is now in the driver seat. She pats her hand on the passenger seat.

        > "Of course the alcohol helped."

        - CATHERINE
            - Never mind that. Will you sit here with me?
        - DICK
            - Is this some kind of kinky shit?

    1. Dick is now seated in the car.

        > "It was all she could do not to gag from the pig's putrid smell of alcohol and sweat."

        - CATHERINE
            - Put your seat-belt on.
        - DICK
            - Ooooooooohhh. Yes, anything you say, my dear.

    1. Closeup of seat-belt clicking into place.

        > "But she had business to attend to."

        - CATHERINE
            - Perfect. Now, I have you right where I want you.
        - DICK _slobbering_
            - Yes, yes. Hey, this thing's a bit tight for me.

    1. Suddenly the driver side door is flung open and hands reach in grabbing Catherine. In the background Dick seems to be struggling with his seat-belt.

        > "But of course things didn't go quite to plan."

        - CATHERINE
            - Arrrghh...
        - DICK
            - Catherine?

1. INTRO - Under the skin

    1. Catherine lands heavily with a thud onto the cold, hard floor. The mystery assailant is shrouded in darkness.

        > "Catherine had been followed."

        - CATHERINE
            - Oooompppf!
        - DICK
            - Who's out there!?

    1. Catherine is on her hands and knees as a kick strikes her in the side of the head sending her sprawling back to the floor.

        - SFX
            - CRACK!

    1. Her blonde hair slide from her head, falling to the floor beside her. A wig. Her real hair, is short and dark, matted with glistening sweat.

        > "Her game was up."

        - ASSAILANT
            - Well, well, well.
        - DICK
            - What's going on. Arrgh, this friggin' belt. I can't move!

    1. In the darkness we see the assailant crouching over the prostrate form of Catherine.

        - ASSAILANT
            - What have we here?

    1. The assailant's hands rub at Catherine's face with a cloth. She murmurs, drifting in and out of consciousness.

        > "Things got darker..."

        - ASSAILANT
            - A real beauty. A real Schlampe.
        - DICK
            - Help! Help me out of here!

    1. Closeup of Catherine's face, the makeup is now gone. It is the face of Martin, the young valet attendant. He is out cold.

        > "And that's the last thing I remember."

1. INTRO - Go to Sleep

    1. The assailant strides over to the open driver's seat door. A gun in his right hand. It appears to be a Glock of some description.

    1. The assailant unleashes a volley of bullets into the passenger side.

        - SFX
            - Bang! Bang! Bang!
        - DICK
            - Oooooooofff!

    1. The assailant strides back to Martin, who is still passed out on the floor.

    1. The handgun is now pointed at Martin's head.

    1. An all black panel. We see nothing but hear the crack of single gun shot.

        - SFX
            - CRACK!!!

1. SJSU - Into the Void

    1. All is dark. Literally, an all-black panel.

    1. A voice comes from the darkness.

        > "Wake up!"

    1. Strange patterns and shapes form in the darkness

        > "Hello, can you hear me?"

    1. From first person POV, a bleary image begins to form of a large, hulking figure towering above. The peripheral vision remains out of focus.

        > "Wake up, god dammit!"

    1. A cacophony of strange underwater-like voices erupt and sweep around the figure in surround sound.

        - SFX
            - Vrrrt-t-t-t-t-t-Vrrrt-t-t-t-t. Thwop-wop-wop-wop. Ssssssshhhhhhwwwww-w-w-w-w-w.

    1. Two eyes and a face come sharply into focus. The face is that of a middle aged African American man. His expression is gravely serious.

1. SJSU - Out of the Void

    1. Martin is slumped over a desk, asleep. The man berating him is his professor, CHARLES DEAKES. He is hunched down on his knees, almost comically for such a big man, so to be at eye-level with the comatose boy. All around him are the laughing, jeering faces of his classmates. In the background a wall placard declares in large writing: "Mechanical And Aerospace Engineering Department"

    1. Martin opens his eyes blearily

        - DEAKES
            - Hello Martin

    1. COLIN, one of the students, bursts into song. He has a round face, red hair and a freckled complexion.

        - COLIN _out of tune_
            - "Hello, is it me you're looking for?"

    1. A further round of laughter ensues. We see closeups of the gleeful faces of the other students.

    1. Closeup of alarm bell on the wall, it rings, signaling the end of class.

        - SFX
            - RING! RING! RING!

1. SJSU - Bell

    1. As the bell continues to wail, we see closeup of books and laptops being packed away into bags.

    1. Martin covers his ears against the wailing of the bell.

    1. A view from under the desk of all the shuffling feet and commotion.

    1. As the students start making their way towards the exits, Deakes yells out over the din of the bell.

        - DEAKES
            - Don't forget everybody. Term papers are due in exactly one week from now!

    1. Colin, the comedian student and friend of Martin's, walks past raising his hand for a high five.

        - COLIN
            - Way to go, buddy! You're my hero.

    1. We see a closeup of their hands as Martin accepts the high five sheepishly.

    1. Two Hispanic girls approach Martin's desk, arm in arm, They wear tight sweaters. They are both smiling and giggling. Martin appears nervous.

1. SJSU - Girls

    1. The girls slide past Martin's desk. As they do, one of the girls places her hand on the desk, leaving something behind. It looks like she has a crush on Martin. Her friend looks on in amusement.

        - RAMONA
            - Hey Martin. I can't wait for tonight.
        - MARTIN
            - Uh, wha..!!??
        - RAMONA _giggling_
            - You know... the concert?
        - MARTIN _blushing_
            - Oh... yeah... thanks. I mean..
        - ALICIA
            - Hee hee.

    1. Martin sits there dumbstruck, staring into space. The girls have gone just as quickly as they arrived.

    1. Martin notices a small folded piece of pink paper on his desk.

        - MARTIN
            - Hmm?

    1. He reaches out for it, not noticing a dark shadow looming over him from behind.

    1. At the same time as Martin's hand covers the piece of paper, a large, dark hand clamps down on his shoulder startling him.

        - DEAKES
            - See me in my office in 5 mins.

    1. A closeup of Martin's face as his left eye and cheek twitches.

        - MARTIN _to himself_
            - Ahhh, crap.

1. HOSPITAL - Visitor

    1. Daytime. Establishing shot outside in plush, Victorian-esque hospital grounds. A large marble sign reads 'Napa State Hospital'

    1. Inside, a young female nurse leads an older, middle-aged lady away from the reception desk area. The young nurse wears a name badge "Emily". The receptionist is head-down in a trashy romantic novel.

        - EMILY
            - Please follow me, Ms...?
        - KATHY
            - Kathy. Please. Call me Kathy.

    1. Closeup of bedside cabinet. A vase contains old dried up flowers. A knock is heard on the door.

        - SFX
            - KNOCK! KNOCK!

    1. The door creaks open. Kathy peers into the room. Emily stays outside behind her.

        - EMILY
            - I'll leave you two alone. Please ring the bell if you need anything.

    1. From behind we see Kathy draw up a chair and sit down by the side of the hospital bed, obscuring the view of the bed's occupant.

    1. Closeup of Kathy's face. Tears forming in her eyes. She has a kind, gentle face, but her hair is graying and wrinkles spread like tiny fissures along her face, as if some torment within is cracking open her very skin.

    1. A young woman lies prostrate on her back in a hospital bed. Her long hair is dark, thick and matted. Eyes firmly closed. A tube protrudes from her mouth and trails off to the machinery and equipment by her bedside, as do the various cables that snake out from under her bedsheets.

        - KATHY
            - Hello Elizabeth, my dear. It's been a long time.

1. SJSU - Deakes

    1. Daytime. Establishing shot. We see a pleasant looking communal courtyard with park benches, a fountain and grass lawns. A large marble wall is engraved with the words 'San Jose State University'

    1. Inside, two male, cauacasian youths slump against the corridor wall. They are dressed in tight, ripped jeans and black t-shirts. One of the youths carries a bundle of promotional concert flyers. One of the flyers is pinned to the wall. It reads "The Butchers. The Lost Boys. Tonight @ the Blue Lagoon. 9pm". A third youth, female, and of Asian descent, stands on her tip-toes and peeks through the window of the door. Other students walk by without paying them much heed. It looks like they are waiting for someone. By the door hangs a small sign: "Professor Deakes".

    1. A desk. Scattered across it, we see many sheets of paper filled with sketches and drawings, ranging from steam trains to parasols. The images have a unique steam punk style. There are also several sketches of ghosts and birds. This is our first insight into the inner workings of Martin's mind.

    1. Side view of desk. Deakes is sitting one one side, hands clasped. He stares sternly at Martin who is sitting across the desk, sipping a cup of strong coffee. In the background, against the wall is a large fish tank. Also on the shelves is a small picture frame, the picture shows a younger Deakes collecting his diploma alongside an old college buddy, Jeff Chapman. Through the door's window, two oriental eyes peer in from the outside corridor.

1. SJSU - Crazy

    1. Closeup of Deakes as he breaks the silence.

        - DEAKES
            - Why are you doing this to yourself, Martin? You know... you're the best damn student this year. Heck you're the best damn student this decade!
            - If... you focus your efforts on your class work.
            - What is it this time? Crazy Uncle? Crazy friends? Crazy *girl*-friends?

    1. Martin has him arms folded defensively.

        - MARTIN
            - He's not crazy. Why do you think he's crazy? Why is it everybody thinks he's crazy! C'mon!
            - And my friends aren't crazy either. Ok? And I don't even *have* a girlfriend!
        - DEAKES
            - Listen, son. Whatever it is. Don't blow it this year.
        - MARTIN
            - I'm not your son.

    1. Deakes appears a little hurt by Martin's rebuff. Martin looks a little ashamed of himself.

        - MARTIN
            - Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

    1. Martin looks away and sighs. His gaze drawn to the photo on the shelf, next to the fish tank.

    1. Closeup of framed photo on shelf.

        - DEAKES _smiling wistfuly_
            - You miss him, don't you? He was a good man, your father. We were pretty tight back then... me and him.
            - Of course he was a lousy quarterback. And ohhh... he was terrible with the ladies. Hah! But, god damn, he knew how to tune an engine. And hell, he was the best driver I've... oh...well... I'm sorry Martin.

    1. Closeup of Martin. He smiles solemnly.

        - MARTIN
            - It doesn't matter. I have a new family now.
        - DEAKES
            - 'Family', huh? Well, you be careful Martin. They aren't all what they seem you know. Your dealing with crooks, and gamblers and bikers and.. and, well let's just say I don't see any of them down at church on Sunday, if you know what I mean.
        - MARTIN
            - The family you come from isn't as important as the family you're going to have.
        - DEAKES
            - Huh? Who said that?
        - MARTIN
            - I don't remember who said it. I just remember it being said to me back then, is all.
        - DEAKES
            - Well. I hope they were right... but remember this... your assignment is due on my desk this time next week. 10am sharp. Don't let me down.

    1. Closeup view of fish tank, next to the photo frame. There is a miniature sail boat bobbing up and down in the water.

        - DEAKES
            - Oh, and I think your 'friends' are out there waiting for you.

1. BIG SUR - La Mer

    1. Daytime. View of the wide open sea from atop the cliffs. Two specks can be made out in the distance on the ocean. The scorching hot sun is burning up the horizon. A sign post reads "California 1. Pacific Coast Highway"

    1. We see a small motorboat proceeding towards the cliff face. Several men appear to be aboard. One man sits at either end, and two sit huddled together in the center, facing each other. A yacht can be seen behind them on the horizon.

    1. Closer view of boat. Two burly, heavyweight men sit at either end of the boat. Vadym and Matthias. They both sport crew-cuts and have the look of bodyguards or hired thugs of some sort. The other two men sit in the middle of the boat, facing each other. Jack wears a white suit and a hat, the other man, Tommy, looks to be naked from the waist up.

    1. Medium closeup of Jack. He has bright anemic-yellow hair underneath a fedora and a white plaster covering what looks like to be a recently broken nose. He looks pale and nervous.

    1. Medium closeup of Tommy. He is wearing nothing but bright yellow swimming trunks. His hair is slicked back and he wears dark, black shades. He has that European look - tanned and toned - he could be French, Italian or even Greek. He could be anywhere between 35 and 55.

    1. Tommy points to a spot at the base of the cliffs about 500 yards away. Vadym, the burly man at stern, holding the outboard motor, acknowledges with a silent, nod. He has short cropped, grey hair. Possibly in his late 50's. He has intelligent, cunning eyes.

1. BIG SUR - Le Mepris

    1. Tommy is now smiling and looking generally thrilled with life as he looks out over the side of the boat. Jack looks glum and nervous.

        - TOMMY
            - Ah! La Mer! How beautiful. To sail over her waves is to sail across a thousand bountiful bosoms!

    1. Closeup as Tommy lights a cigarette and speaks out of the side of his mouth.

        - TOMMY
            - Of course, we're not sailing - it's a motorboat. But that's beside the point.

    1. Tommy inhales his cigarette and looks away wistfully.

        - TOMMY
            - You know, Jack - my old friend. This reminds me of a scene from a movie. Le Mepris. You know what Le Mepris means?

    1. Closeup of Jack as he frowns and shakes his head.

        - TOMMY
            - It means 'contempt'. The story is of a beautiful partnership gone wrong. Very much like us, don't you think?

    1. Closeup of Jack as he gulps and wipes away the beads of perspiration from his brow.

        - TOMMY
            - Before you got too greedy. Before you tried to fuck me over.

    1. Tommy lowers his glasses and peers into Jack's eyes.

        - TOMMY
            - I was your Bridget Bardot, you dumb son of a bitch.

    1. Tommy snaps out of his nostalgia, and flicks away his cigarette into the sea.

        - TOMMY
            - Ok boys, this is the spot. Vadym, guide us in.

1. POLICE DEPT. - Bad Shot

    1. A hand polishing the barrel of a gun with a cloth. The gun is a Glock 22, standard police issue, all in black.

    1. Closeup of steel-grey eyes looking down the gun barrel.

1. POLICE DEPT. - Introductions

    1. A door opens. Greig McDonald, a portly old policeman with a ruddy complexion enters the room, followed by a young female officer in tow. On the wall a large placard reads: 'City of Santa Cruz Police Department'

        - GREIG
            - Kurt! Don't ye know how to fire a gun yet?

    1. We now see the face of the shooter. His face is cold and hard. His shortly cropped iron grey hair only serves to add to his imposing presence.

        - KURT
            - Who's this?
        - GREIG
            - Now now, Kurt. Have ye forgotten yer manners? In front of a lady too!

    1. The woman steps forward and holds out her hand to Kurt. She has sharply defined cheekbones and a steely, determination about her. She wears her hair in a short bob, adding to her tomboyish appearance.

        - MELISSA
            - Melissa. Melissa Jenkins, sir. I was sorry to hear about your partner. I...

    1. Kurt ignores both her sentiment and her outstretched hand.

            - Verdammt!!!

1. POLICE DEPT. - Good shot

    1. Melissa walks over to the next gun lane, she shoves aside the young officer standing there, unloosening her holster as she does so.

            - Outta my way!

    1. View from behind as Melissa takes up a shooting stance and fires off a full round of bullets into the paper target.

        - SFX
            - BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

    1. The paper target now whisks towards her. Kurt and Greig look perplexed.

    1. Melissa takes down the paper target and thrusts it into the hands of the astonished young police officer, before storming towards the exit - her gun now back in it's holster.

        - MELISSA
            - We don't need ladies who can't shoot straight now do we?

    1. The young police officer holds up the target. We see a heart shape formed by the bullet holes.

    1. Closeup as Greig smiles. A big gleeful smile.

        - GREIG
            - Oh, I think you two are going to get along famously.

        - KURT
            - Himmel, arsch und Zwirn!

1. HOSPITAL - Storytelling

    1. A coffee cup, piled high with cigarette butts.

    1. Two pairs of hands, one laid on top of the other, clasped together. One pair of hands is wrinkled and stained with nicotine, the other hands are young yet ghastly pale.

    1. Elizabeth's face. As lifeless as we saw her before.

        - KATHY
            - I just had to tell somebody, before... before it's too late.
            - I can't go to the grave knowing the things I do. Keeping the secrets that I do.
            - I pray, in your heart, that you can forgive me.

    1. Kathy bends down from her seat, and digs around in her handbag, looking for a new packet of cigarettes.

        - KATHY
            - Oh damn. Where did I put that extra pack?
            - Excuse me dear, while I go and hunt down more cancer sticks.
            - They can't hurt me now, right?

    1. As Kathy departs the room, a large black raven swoops down onto the window ledge.

    1. The raven squawks twice, cocking it's head as it does so.

1. HIGHWAY 17 - Speed

    1. Birds eye view of highway 17. Directly below we see a bus and several motorbikes amongst the steadily building rush-hour traffic.

    1. Front view of bus. The front of the bus reads "17 Express". We see an overweight female driver, dressed in blue uniform. Her lipstick is a garish red, her hair long, black and braided.

    1. A passenger on the bus reading some kind of spiritual enlightenment book. The cover of the book reads, "Yoga Vasistha". All is calm and peaceful.

    1. Closeup of Martin's face, contorted with the wind as he speeds along the highway on his motorbike. He is wearing vintage leather goggles.

    1. Martin looks over his shoulder. 3 other youths on bikes are close behind, in scattered formation, weaving through traffic.

1. HIGHWAY 17 - Pursuit

    1. Side view, low down of Martin on his bike. We see his bike in full detail. The engine purring.

    1. Martin draws up about 50 yards behind the bus and closing fast. He is in the center of three lanes. A sign on the inside road says "lanes merge 500 yards"

    1. Martin moves over to the outside fast lane. But his way seems blocked by traffic.

    1. With the fast lane blocked, Martin falls back and then hits the accelerator to speed past the bus on the empty inside lane. We see a sign saying lane ends 100 yards.

    1. Martin gets half way alongside the bus. Up ahead less than 20 yards, the road merges into concrete barriers.

    1. Martin grits his teeth and stamps on the accelerator...

1. HIGHWAY 17 - Close shave

    1. At the very last second Martin quickly dips his bike and cuts inside to avoid the low concrete wall by mere inches, but in doing so cuts in front of the bus

    1. The passenger on the bus is thrown forward - grabbing a rail to steady himself - his book flying from his hands.

        - PASSENGER
            - Heeeeeyyyy!

    1. Martin looks over his shoulder. Brian and Alex are in the fast lane now, but blocked by the traffic.

        - MARTIN
            - Wooooooooooohooooooo!

    1. Martin begins to pump his fist in celebration, but Lee suddenly swoops out of nowhere to pull alongside a startled Martin. She is grinning like the cat that caught the cream.

    1. Kurt and Melissa sit upfront in the patrol car. It is parked in the lay by.

1. CHESS PIECES - Afternoon

    1. Jack sits huddled, alone on a rock. He is naked now, expect for his hat placed over his groin. Waves crash around him. The boat containing Vadym, Matthias and Tommy can be seen disappearing into the distance.

    1. Kathy sits alone in a restroom cubicle. She sobs uncontrollably, her heads in her hands. At her feet lies her over-sized handbag, it's gold clasp left ajar.

    1. Deakes sits in his office, the photograph of Martin's father now held in his hand as he inspects it closely.

    1. We see gloved hands operating a keyboard and mouse, above which a flickering computer terminal displays the words 'Permission Denied - Restricted Access Records - Melissa Jenkins'.

    1. Ramona and Alicia stand side-by-side facing a mirror, they sing and dance with glee as they look to be preparing themselves for a night of festivity ahead.

    1. Finally, we see Kurt striding purposefully away from the police car, his hand flexing menacingly over the police stick which hangs from his belt.
