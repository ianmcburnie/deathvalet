<p class="sceneheading" id="O9pejpe0">INTRO - The Family Business<br>
</p>
<p id="Lq5Ceie0" class="shot">A&nbsp;young man stands upright and alert by a
brightly lit exterior wall.&nbsp;He is smartly dressed in waistcoat, shirt and
tie. His short dark hair is swept back and to one side, framing a youthful,
handsome face. A name badge pinned to his breast pocket reads, "MARTIN". A
small podium stands beside him, it’s surface littered with papers, business
cards and a clunky looking cell phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="caption">"The family you came from isn't as important as the family
you're going to."</p>
<p id="Lq5C8he0" class="shot">Some 10 feet above Martin, a neon sign, fixed
high up to the wall, blazes the words "TOMMY'S CLUB CASINO. GIRLS, SLOTS,
POKER, $$$", bathing Martin in it's multicolored light. Martin checks his wrist
watch anxiously.</p>
<p class="caption">"At least, that's what somebody once told me."</p>
<p id="ibnbAJe0" class="shot">Nearby in the doorway stands the proprietor
himself, Tommy. A rather swarthy looking gentleman, he holds open the door with
one arm, looking out into the night, slightly pensive. He is casually dressed,
in polo shirt and slacks, yet carries with him a formidable air.&nbsp;He has a
Mediterranean look - tanned and toned - and could be anywhere between 35 and 55.</p>
<p id="3oRgUoZHGXn5" class="caption">"My uncle Tommy put me to work as a valet
as soon as I was old enough to drive."<br>
</p>
<p id="rhsbrA20" class="shot">View from behind steering wheel of a car. A
Mercedes badge on the hood. Two pudgy hands grasp the wheel, their fingers
adorned with large, ugly rings. The Mercedes approaches the casino entrance. A
sign by the curbside reads ‘STOP HERE FOR VALET PARKING’.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"I've always loved cars. I've had a fascination with them
ever since I was a young boy."</p>
<p id="Lq5Cfie0" class="shot">The Mercedes is now stationary by the curb,
driver side door open. The driver, Dick, is now out of the car and tosses the
keys to Martin. Martin is already braced for the catch. Dick is old and portly,
with a wheezing, red face. His cowboy-style attire is clearly one size too
small. Cream trousers, cream shirt. Brown sweat stains. The man oozes sleaze.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"Some say it's a morbid fascination."</p>
<p class="character">DICK<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Take good care of it, boy.<br>
</p>
<p id="Lq5C4ie0" class="shot">Dick follows Tommy through the entrance. There is
no greeting between the two men. From behind them comes the roar of the car
engine and screech of tires.</p>
<p class="caption">"Everyone had heard the story of how my dad&nbsp;died."</p>
<p class="character">SFX</p>
<p class="dialog">VROOM!</p>
<p id="Lq5Ceje0" class="shot">Dick turns, his face flustered, red and angry.
The car screeches off. Dick curses under his breath. A wry smile plays on the
lips of Tommy.<br>
</p>
<p class="character">DICK<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Little bastard!<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"And that my uncle Tommy raised me as his own."</p>
<p class="sceneheading" id="hawe3150">INTRO - Home Sweet Home</p>
<p id="Lq5CGje0" class="shot">The Mercedes halts at a parking garage gate.
Martin's hand reaches out of the driver side window, inserting a card into
the&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p class="caption">"He gave me a roof over my head."</p>
<p id="Lq5Cgje0" class="shot">The silver car accelerates through the gate, it's
tires screeching, into a high ceilinged parking garage. Bulky pillars support
the concrete structure. There are&nbsp;cars parked on either side.</p>
<p class="caption">"With all the cars I ever wanted."</p>
<p class="character">SFX</p>
<p class="dialog">SCREECH!</p>
<p id="Mq5Cdje0" class="shot">View from bottom of down-ramp as the large,
silver car descends the&nbsp;incline. The bright glare of the headlights
sweeping aside the darkness below.</p>
<p class="caption">"I even have my own basement."</p>
<p class="character"></p>
<p class="character"></p>
<p id="cMSKEypGwUSt" class="shot">The basement appears to be a converted
workshop, containing all kinds of cars, bikes and assorted machinery in various
states of repair.</p>
<p class="caption">"Nobody ever disturbs me down there."</p>
<p id="Mq5Ccje0" class="shot">In an illuminated corner of the parking garage
stands a huge corrogated metal shipping container. A small wooden placard hangs
by string on the container's makeshift door, it reads: "HOME SWEET HOME".&nbsp;</p>
<p class="caption">"I mostly have the place to myself."</p>
<p id="Mq5Chke0" class="shot">As the car slows to a halt, we see a closeup of
the spinning gyration of the hub cap. It's polished silver surface reflects the
hazy form of a person standing by the car.</p>
<p class="caption">"Mostly."</p>
<p class="sceneheading" id="lQweB4c0">INTRO - Queen of Diamonds</p>
<p id="7IMbLnf0" class="shot">A&nbsp;roulette wheel, birds-eye-view, the ball
nestled in the number 6.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"I'm too young to work in the casino."</p>
<p id="PJMbi970" class="shot">The people at the table cheer loudly, throw their
arms in the air, and hug each other. A few dejected souls hold their heads in
their hands, slumped over the table in despair.</p>
<p id="JZplTBy8gjQZ" class="caption">"Too young too gamble. Too young to drink."<br>
</p>
<p id="Mq5CFke0" class="shot">At a nearby blackjack table, Dick sits on a stool
surveying his two cards. His face is a look of disgust. He is a little drunk. A
large tumbler of tequila sits on the table by his left hand.&nbsp;Dick raps his
knuckles on the table, signaling the dealer for another twist of the cards.</p>
<p id="xHd2RQvvhSlH" class="caption">"The place is full of addicts, crooks,
perverts, you name it."<br>
</p>
<p class="character">DICK<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Hit me. C'mon. Hit me you fuck.</p>
<p class="character"></p>
<p id="Mq5Cike0" class="shot">The dealer turns another card. It's the Queen of
Diamonds. Dick is bust.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"They kind of became my extended family."</p>
<p class="character">DEALER</p>
<p class="dialog">Not your night, sir. Why don't you take a break?</p>
<p class="character"></p>
<p id="DHMbPic0" class="shot">This only serves to enrage Dick further, who
stands up and leans forward as if intending to grab hold of the dealer on the
other side of the table. At the same time, a woman, dressed all in black,
places her hand on the empty seat beside Dick.</p>
<p class="caption">"Nobody gets to choose their&nbsp;family, do they?"</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p id="GfDjG8OtkUcR" class="dialog">A break!? I'll break your god damn...&nbsp;</p>
<p id="nEObhi00" class="shot">Dick now notices her presence. She has now seated
herself in the chair beside Dick. She flashes him a quick smile, effectively
diffusing the situation with the dealer. Dick, bleary-eyed now, looks her up
and down without any pretense at subtlety. Her face is heavy with makeup. She
wears a slender, high-neckline black cocktail dress. A string of diamonds lie
across her neck. Her hair is shoulder-length and blond.</p>
<p class="caption">"So, anyway, Dick here was the casino PR man. He'd take
photos, arrange events, that kind of thing."</p>
<p id="Mq5C1le0" class="shot">Dick, still not taking his eyes of Catherine,
signals for the waitress' attention, with a loud snap of his fingers.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"Everyone knew he was a pervert and a voyeur."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Drinks! Drinks for my friend! And while you're at it, get me
another one too!</p>
<p class="sceneheading" id="lzyeP3a0">INTRO - Devil in Disguise</p>
<p id="Mq5COle0" class="shot">Inside the parking garage. It's dark. We see
Dick's silver mercedes looming in the foreground. A wide view as Dick and
Catherine stumble arm-in-arm down the incline of the ramp. Dick has had too
much to drink. Catherine supports his weight with apparent ease.</p>
<p class="caption">"So it wasn't too difficult for Catherine to get him right
where she wanted."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Where the hell are we going? I can't see a thing down here.<br>
</p>
<p id="nyXQeKmoei4E" class="shot">View from inside the car, through the driver
side window as Catherine unlocks the car.</p>
<p class="caption">"The fat sleazeball was practically on a leash."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">We shouldn't be down here. That little freak will catch us.</p>
<p id="Mq5Cxle0" class="shot">Closeup of Catherine's face. Her left eye and
cheek twitching noticeably.<br>
</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Hey, how did you get my key?</p>
<p id="Mq5CNle0" class="shot">Catherine is now in the driver seat. She holds
one finger up to her lips, shushing him, and pats her other hand on the
passenger seat.</p>
<p class="caption">"Of course the alcohol helped."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(chuckling)</p>
<p class="dialog">Ooooooooohhh. Yes, anything you say, my dear.</p>
<p class="dialog"></p>
<p id="Mq5Cdle0" class="shot">Dick is now seated in the car. Catherine reaches
over him for his seat belt</p>
<p class="caption">"It was all she could do not to gag from the pig's putrid
smell of alcohol and sweat."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Is this some kind of kinky shit?</p>
<p class="dialog"></p>
<p id="Mq5C3le0" class="shot">Closeup of seat-belt clicking into place.</p>
<p class="caption">"But she had business to attend to."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(slobbering)</p>
<p class="dialog">Yes, yes. Hey, this thing's a bit tight for me.</p>
<p id="Unl47MveQRY3" class="shot">Suddenly the driver side door is flung open
and hands reach in grabbing Catherine, as Dick continues to&nbsp;struggle with
his seat-belt.</p>
<p class="caption">"But of course things didn't go quite to plan."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Catherine?</p>
<p class="sceneheading" id="lHsgae40">INTRO - Under the skin</p>
<p id="Mq5CKle0" class="shot">Catherine lands heavily with a thud onto the
cold, hard floor. The mystery assailant is shrouded in darkness.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"She'd&nbsp;been followed."</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Who's out there!?</p>
<p id="Mq5Cale0" class="shot">Catherine is on her hands and knees as a kick
strikes her in the side of the head sending her sprawling back to the floor.<br>
</p>
<p id="Mq5Crle0" class="shot">Her blonde hair slides from her head, falling to
the floor beside her. A wig. Her real hair is short and dark, matted with
glistening sweat.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"Her game was up."</p>
<p class="character">ASSAILANT<br>
</p>
<p class="dialog">Well, well, well.</p>
<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">What's going on out there? Arrgh, this friggin' belt. I can't
move!</p>
<p id="NWaw5mXnd3OA" class="shot">In the darkness we see the assailant
crouching over the prostrate form of Catherine.<br>
</p>

</p>
<p class="dialog">What have we here?<br>
</p>
<p id="1b84dqL5Vp8W" class="shot">The assailant's hands rub at Catherine's face
with a cloth. She murmurs, drifting in and out of consciousness.</p>

<p class="dialog">A real beauty. A real Schlampe.<br>

<p class="character">DICK</p>
<p class="dialog">Help! Help me out of here!</p>
<p id="Mq5C1me0" class="shot">Closeup of Catherine's face, the makeup is now
gone. It is the face of Martin. He is out cold.<br>
</p>
<p class="caption">"And that's the last thing I remember."</p>
<p id="Qr7bto80" class="sceneheading">INTRO - Bang, bang<br>
</p>
<p id="Mq5Cime0" class="shot">The assailant strides over to the open driver
side door. A gun in his right hand. It appears to be a Glock of some
description. Dick senses the danger and cries out in alarm.<br>

</p>
<p class="dialog">No! Don't do it! I'll do any...<br>

the passenger side, silencing Dick instantly.</p>
