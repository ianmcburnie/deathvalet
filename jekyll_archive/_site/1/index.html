    <p>INTRO - Valet</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>A modest, single-story casino lies nestled among the huge, redwood trees of an old mountain highway. The neon lights read “Tommy’s Casino”.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“The family you came from isn’t as important as the family you’re going to…”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A silver Mercedes approaches the main driveway of the casino. Behind the tint of the windows, the driver’s features remain indistinguishable.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“…at least, that’s what somebody once told me.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We see Martin, a young valet attendant standing outside the Casino entrance. He is smartly dressed in charcoal trousers, black shoes, burgundy waistcoat and white shirt. He is around 5,10”. His short dark hair is swept back and to one side, framing his youthful, handsome face. A name badge is pinned to his breast pocket. A small desk/podium stands beside him. Littered about it’s surface are papers, business cards and a clunky looking cell phone.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“My uncle put me to work at the valet as soon as I was old enough to drive.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>View from inside the silver car pulling up to attendant. We only see the driver’s hands on the wheel. His pudgy fingers are adorned with large, ugly rings. A sign by the curb reads ‘Valet Parking’.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“I’ve always loved cars.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The driver, Dick, has stepped out of the car and is passing the keys to the young attendant. The car door remains open. Dick is portly, and has a wheezing red-face. Somewhere around 50 years old. He wears western, cowboy style attire that is one size too small for him. Cream trousers and a cream shirt. Brown sweat stains. The man oozes sleaze.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“I’ve had a fascination with them ever since I was a young boy.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>

      <li>
        <p>Closeup of Martin’s hand taking the key. The key loop placed over one finger. The key is in the shape of a naked lady. We see the boy’s name badge, it reads ‘MARTIN’.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Some would even say a morbid fascination.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dick walks through the automatic double doors of the casino entrance. Behind him is the roar of the car engine.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Everyone in town knew what my father had done.”</p>
        </blockquote>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dick stops and turns around, his face flustered and angry. The car screeches off.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“And how his brother, my uncle, stepped in and raised me as his own.”</p>
        </blockquote>

    <p>INTRO - Garage</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The silver car is at a parking garage gate. Martin’s hand reaches out of the driver side window, taking a ticket from the machine.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“He gave me a roof over my head.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The gate rises and the car accelerates into the large indoor parking garage ahead.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“He gave me a <em>big</em> roof over my head.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The silver car accelerates down the straight section. There are cars parked on either side.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“With all the cars I ever wanted.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The silver car brakes sharply, it’s tires screeching on the polished surface. We see an up ramp to the roof level, the twinkling stars visible above, and a down ramp, with only darkness below.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“I have a rooftop balcony, where I sit and watch the stars at night.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>SFX
            <ul>
              <li>Screeeeeech!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The silver car turns sharply to take the down ramp, wheels squeaking loudly again.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“But best of all, I have my own basement.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>View from bottom of down-ramp as the large, silver car descends the steep incline. The bright glare of the headlights drowns us in light.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“It’s all a kid ever wanted.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are no overhead lights on in the basement, so we see very little. There don’t appear to be any other valet cars parked here. The silver car rolls along slowly.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Nobody ever disturbs me down here.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We now see an illuminated corner of the parking garage. There is a collection of cars and bikes and other assorted machinery. They look like they have been worked on by a mechanic. Some have doors missing, or their engines stripped. Others are jacked up without wheels.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“I mostly have the place to myself.”</p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As the car slows to a halt, we see a closeup of the spinning gyration of the hub cap. It’s polished silver surface seems to reflect the hazy form of a young child standing by the car.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Mostly…”</p>

        <p>View of a spinning roulette wheel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The wheels stops, the ball nestles in the number 6. The people at the table cheer loudly, and hug each other.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“I’m too young to work in the casino.”</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>At a nearby blackjack table, Dick is surveying his two cards. We see a ten and a six. Dick’s face is a look of disgust. He is a little drunk. A large tumbler of tequila sits on the table by his left hand. The dealer waits patiently.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Too young too gamble. Too young to drink.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>DICK <em>to nobody in particular</em>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Closeup of Dick rapping his knuckles on the table, signaling the dealer for another twist of the cards.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“The place is full of addicts, crooks, perverts, you name it.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>DICK
            <ul>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The dealer turns another card. It’s the Queen of Diamonds. The dealer looks embarrassed and tries to steer Dick away from losing more money, but Dick loses his temper further.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Any kind of degenerate you could imagine, they were right here. My uncle would roll out the mat.”</p>
        </blockquote>

          <li>DEALER
            <ul>
              <li>Not your night, sir. Why don’t you take a break?</li>

    <p>INTRO - Queen</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>A woman slides up to the table and seats herself by Dick, diffusing the situation. Her face is heavy with makeup. She wears a slender, high-neckline black cocktail dress. A string of diamonds lie across her neck. Her hair is shoulder-length and blond.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“They became my extended family.”</p>

        </ul>
      </li>

        <p>Catherine seats herself beside Dick. Dick looks her up and down, approvingly.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“But nobody gets to choose their own family, do they?”</p>

    <p>INTRO - Devil in Disguise</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Inside the parking garage. It’s dark. We see Dick’s silver car looming in the foreground. Dick and Catherine stumble arm-in-arm through the garage in the background. Dick has had too much to drink and Catherine supports his weight with apparent ease.</p>

        <blockquote>

        <p>Martin is slumped over a desk, asleep. The man berating him is his professor, CHARLES DEAKES. He is hunched down on his knees, almost comically for such a big man, so to be at eye-level with the comatose boy. All around him are the laughing, jeering faces of his classmates. In the background a wall placard declares in large writing: “Mechanical And Aerospace Engineering Department”</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inside, two male, cauacasian youths slump against the corridor wall. They are dressed in tight, ripped jeans and black t-shirts. One of the youths carries a bundle of promotional concert flyers. One of the flyers is pinned to the wall. It reads “The Butchers. The Lost Boys. Tonight @ the Blue Lagoon. 9pm”. A third youth, female, and of Asian descent, stands on her tip-toes and peeks through the window of the door. Other students walk by without paying them much heed. It looks like they are waiting for someone. By the door hangs a small sign: “Professor Deakes”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A desk. Scattered across it, we see many sheets of paper filled with sketches and drawings, ranging from steam trains to parasols. The images have a unique steam punk style. There are also several sketches of ghosts and birds. This is our first insight into the inner workings of Martin’s mind.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Side view of desk. Deakes is sitting one one side, hands clasped. He stares sternly at Martin who is sitting across the desk, sipping a cup of strong coffee. In the background, against the wall is a large fish tank. Also on the shelves is a small picture frame, the picture shows a younger Deakes collecting his diploma alongside an old college buddy, Jeff Chapman. Through the door’s window, two oriental eyes peer in from the outside corridor.</p>

              <li>Of course he was a lousy quarterback. And ohhh… he was terrible with the ladies. Hah! But, god damn, he knew how to tune an engine. And hell, he was the best driver I’ve… oh…well… I’m sorry Martin.</li>

    <p>BIG SUR - La Mer</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Daytime. View of the wide open sea from atop the cliffs. Two specks can be made out in the distance on the ocean. The scorching hot sun is burning up the horizon. A sign post reads “California 1. Pacific Coast Highway”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We see a small motorboat proceeding towards the cliff face. Several men appear to be aboard. One man sits at either end, and two sit huddled together in the center, facing each other. A yacht can be seen behind them on the horizon.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Closer view of boat. Two burly, heavyweight men sit at either end of the boat. Vadym and Matthias. They both sport crew-cuts and have the look of bodyguards or hired thugs of some sort. The other two men sit in the middle of the boat, facing each other. Jack wears a white suit and a hat, the other man, Tommy, looks to be naked from the waist up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Medium closeup of Jack. He has bright anemic-yellow hair underneath a fedora and a white plaster covering what looks like to be a recently broken nose. He looks pale and nervous.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Medium closeup of Tommy. He is wearing nothing but bright yellow swimming trunks. His hair is slicked back and he wears dark, black shades. He has that European look - tanned and toned - he could be French, Italian or even Greek. He could be anywhere between 35 and 55.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tommy points to a spot at the base of the cliffs about 500 yards away. Vadym, the burly man at stern, holding the outboard motor, acknowledges with a silent, nod. He has short cropped, grey hair. Possibly in his late 50’s. He has intelligent, cunning eyes.</p>

        <p>Tommy is now smiling and looking generally thrilled with life as he looks out over the side of the boat. Jack looks glum and nervous.</p>

          <li>TOMMY
            <ul>
              <li>Ah! La Mer! How beautiful. To sail over her waves is to sail across a thousand bountiful bosoms!</li>

    <p>POLICE DEPT. - Introductions</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>A door opens. Greig McDonald, a portly old policeman with a ruddy complexion enters the room, followed by a young female officer in tow. On the wall a large placard reads: ‘City of Santa Cruz Police Department’</p>

        <ul>
          <li>GREIG
            <ul>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We now see the face of the shooter. His face is cold and hard. His shortly cropped iron grey hair only serves to add to his imposing presence.</p>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The woman steps forward and holds out her hand to Kurt. She has sharply defined cheekbones and a steely, determination about her. She wears her hair in a short bob, adding to her tomboyish appearance.</p>

          <li>MELISSA

    <p>HIGHWAY 17 - Speed</p>

    <ol>

        <p>Birds eye view of highway 17. Directly below we see a bus and several motorbikes amongst the steadily building rush-hour traffic.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Front view of bus. The front of the bus reads “17 Express”. We see an overweight female driver, dressed in blue uniform. Her lipstick is a garish red, her hair long, black and braided.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A passenger on the bus reading some kind of spiritual enlightenment book. The cover of the book reads, “Yoga Vasistha”. All is calm and peaceful.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Martin draws up about 50 yards behind the bus and closing fast. He is in the center of three lanes. A sign on the inside road says “lanes merge 500 yards”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Martin moves over to the outside fast lane. But his way seems blocked by traffic.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With the fast lane blocked, Martin falls back and then hits the accelerator to speed past the bus on the empty inside lane. We see a sign saying lane ends 100 yards.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Martin gets half way alongside the bus. Up ahead less than 20 yards, the road merges into concrete barriers.</p>

          <li>MARTIN
            <ul>
              <li>Wooooooooooohooooooo!</li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Martin begins to pump his fist in celebration, but Lee suddenly swoops out of nowhere to pull alongside a startled Martin. She is grinning like the cat that caught the cream.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>MARTIN
            <ul>

        <p>Closeup of a police siren and flashing lights.</p>

        <p>Lee blows Martin a kiss, she has already accelerated away, leaving him behind for dust.</p>

    <p>HIGHWAY PATROL - Snared</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Kurt and Melissa sit upfront in the patrol car. It is parked in the lay by.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>From their view through the windscreen we see the lonesome figure of Martin, helmet still on, but his gloves off - already thrown disgustedly to the floor.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CHESS PIECES - Afternoon</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Jack sits huddled, alone on a rock. He is naked now, expect for his hat placed over his groin. Waves crash around him. The boat containing Vadym, Matthias and Tommy can be seen disappearing into the distance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Kathy sits alone in a restroom cubicle. She sobs uncontrollably, her heads in her hands. At her feet lies her over-sized handbag, it’s gold clasp left ajar.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Deakes sits in his office, the photograph of Martin’s father now held in his hand as he inspects it closely.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We see gloved hands operating a keyboard and mouse, above which a flickering computer terminal displays the words ‘Permission Denied - Restricted Access Records - Melissa Jenkins’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ramona and Alicia stand side-by-side facing a mirror, they sing and dance with glee as they look to be preparing themselves for a night of festivity ahead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Finally, we see Kurt striding purposefully away from the police car, his hand flexing menacingly over the police stick which hangs from his belt.</p>
      </li>
