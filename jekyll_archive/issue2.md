1. PROLOGUE - Diner

    1. A roadside diner, set back fifty feet from the road and nestled amongst tall, ancient trees. The large parking lot out front is illuminated only by the fluorescent light coming from within. A battered old estate car and two pristine, heavy goods vehicles sit in the lot. The pale moon is blanketed by dark, ominous clouds. Where there are gaps between trees there is only the darkness of the night.

    1. A tired looking sign above the entrance reads: "Diner". A wild dog, or maybe it's a wolf or coyote, scavenges for food scraps around the large metal bins.

1. PROLOGUE - Jukebox

    1. Inside, business is slow. Two children (1st graders) push quarters into the coin slot of a large, cabinet-sized jukebox. A waitress carries a pot of coffee towards two flannel shirted men sat at the bar.

    1. The two young children, boy and girl, push their noses against the glass of the jukebox.

    1. Inside the jukebox, a mechanical arm retrieves a small vinyl disc. The disc is but one of hundreds, lined up neatly along an interior shelf.

    1. The disc is lowered onto the revolving turntable.

    1. The disc spins and wobbles.

    1. The needle falls into place with a soft thud followed by a warm, soothing crackle.

1. PROLOGUE - Waitress

    1. The waitress pours coffee into the mugs of the two truckers. Her name badge reads "Jean". A small tower of blond hair sits neatly atop her head, held together by a clasp.

        > "Are you lonesome tonight? Do you miss me tonight? Are you sorry we drifted apart?"

    1. The bearded truckers seem oblivious of each other, and stare blankly at the TV raised high up on the wall above the sparsely-stocked bar.

        > "Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day? When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?"

    1. CNN is broadcasting live coverage of the Gulf War. SCUD missiles soar across the Iraqi desert.

        > "Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?"

    1. As the waitress walks away, fixing a stray blond hair as she goes, the truckers swivel their heads to admire her shapely figure.

        > "Is your heart filled with pain?"

    1. She now sits in a table booth by the window, loose hair firmly back in place. Pages of financial accounts lie scattered across the table. Pencil, notepad and calculator are close at hand. The front of the notebook is engraved in small letters with the name "Kathy". She seems to consider opening it for a second.

        > "Shall I come back again?"

    1. She now looks wistfully out of the window, but sees nothing but her own, glum reflection.

        > "Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"

1. PROLOGUE - Highway

    1. Birds-eye view of the winding mountain road.

        > "I wonder if you're lonesome tonight..."

    1. A battered, flatbed truck careers wildly along the highway, it's headlights on full beam.

        > "You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part..."

    1. The truck overtakes a car at high speed on a narrow bend. The driver of the car has to swerve dangerously towards the side of the road, sounding his horn and raising his fist in annoyance at the reckless truck driver.  

        > "Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart..."

    1. Inside the truck, the driver pays no heed to the irate motorist. This man's face is filled with his own silent rage. His bleary eyes strain to focus on the white lines of the road ahead.

        > "Act one was when we met, I loved you at first glance..."

    1. He takes a long swig from a liquor bottle.

    1. Closeup of truck driver's free hand on the wheel. On the dashboard is a photograph of a strikingly beautiful woman. Her face angelic and coy and surrounded by locks of glorious blond hair.

        > "You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue..."

1. PROLOGUE - Polaroid

    1. Closeup of his face - still strained and tormented as before. His eyes now fixed downwards on the photograph.

        > "Then came act two, you seemed to change, you acted strange..."

    1. He now holds both the whiskey and the photograph in his left hand, perilously close to the open driver side window.

        > "And why? I've never known..."

    1. From outside we see the photograph being tossed out of the window. The wind eagerly snatches it away and up into the night.

        > "Honey, you lied when you said you loved me..."

    1. The truck careers wildly on down the highway, becomes a speck in the distance, as the photograph continues it's wild, airborne dance. In a lay-by sits a parked highway patrol car, it's exterior lights off.

        > "And I had no cause to doubt you..."

1. PROLOGUE - Kamikaze

    1. The waitress sits in the booth by the window with her accounts, pencil and calculator in hand. She rubs her forehead in consternation.

        > "Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there with emptiness all around..."

    1. One of the old truckers becomes agitated, and points in the direction of the window.

        > "And if you won't come back to me..."

    1. The waitress looks up, she has to shield her eyes with her hands from the sudden glare of headlights from outside.

        > "Then they can bring the curtain down."

    1. Her face is now a picture of almost quizzical terror as she stumbles backwards away from the window. Behind her, still by the jukebox, the children remain rooted to the spot.

        > "Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?"

    1. The driver is now hunched over the wheel, his eyes narrow and bleary.

        > "Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"

    1. His eyes suddenly come alive - wide open now, wild & confused.

1. HIGHWAY PATROL - Stick

    1. View from highway patrol car dashboard closing in behind Martin on his bike.

    1. Martin slows his speed and pulls over to the side of the road.

    1. The police car and bike are now at a halt in a roadside lay-by. Through the windscreen, we see that it is Kurt and Melissa in the car.

    1. Kurt turns to Melissa, one hand on the door handle.

        - KURT
            - Stay here.

    1. Kurt strides purposefully towards Martin, who is sitting down - head in his hands.

    1. Closeup of Kurt's mouth as he sneers. Spit and saliva form in the corner of his mouth.

    1. Closeup of Kurt's hand flexing on his baton/stick. He looks filled with violent intent.

1. HIGHWAY PATROL - King Kurt

    1. Martin looks up, a flicker of recognition crosses his face.

        - KURT
            - Just what in the hell are you making with a stunt like that?

    1. Martin raises himself up off the ground. His despair now turned to relief.

        - MARTIN
            - Hey! Uncle Kurt!!?? I haven't seen you since...
        - KURT _grimacing_
            - Martin? Sheisse! Aren't you very old for this 'uncle' crap now?

    1. Martin looks embarrassed

        - MARTIN
            - I... ugh...uhmmm. Sorry. Listen I was going too fast. I... ugh... gotta get home for an assignment... and I've got a gig. And uhm I gotta work tonight too.
        - KURT
            - What in the hell is wrong with you? Is this your death wish, boy?

    1. Martin doesn't know what to say. He scratches the back of his head nervously.

    1. After pausing for thought, Kurt continues..

        - KURT
            - Listen. I let you go with a warning this time, because we both know your *real* uncle will be breaking my balls if I don't.
        - MARTIN
            - You still see him then?
        - KURT
            - Ha! I don't need to see him for him to be breaking my balls. Nobody needs to see him for this.
        - MARTIN
            - I...I... don't know what..
        - KURT
            - Go. Get outta here. Don't let me be catching you again.

    1. As Kurt returns towards the police car, the passenger side door opens and an enraged Melissa jumps out.

1. HIGHWAY PATROL - Hitchhiker

    1. Melissa raises her arms, yelling at Kurt.

        - MELISSA
            - Well!? Is that it!?
        - KURT
            - Get back in the car.
        - MELISSA
            - You need to ticket this punk! And what about his friends!? You're just going to let them go too!?
        - KURT
            - I am in charge here. Get back in the car.

    1. Kurt opens the driver side door.  Martin watches the proceedings with interest. His eyes drawn to Melissa.

    1. Kurt is now already back in the driver's seat. The door closed, his window open. Melissa stands, hands on hips, exasperated.

        - KURT
            - Get in.
        - MELISSA
            - No way! Not until...

    1. With that the highway patrol car spins it's wheels on the loose dirt, before speeding off and leaving Melissa behind.

        - KURT
            - Dummkopf.

    1. Melissa throws her arms up.

        - MESLISSA
            - Really!? Arghh! You are such an asshole.

    1. Martin coughs.

        - MARTIN
            - Ahem. Need a ride?

1. BIG SUR - Hot Tub

    1. Tommy is leaning back in the hot tub, eyes-closed, arms stretched out either side. His face has a serene quality about it. Gloria sits opposite him. She is naked from the waist up. She appears to be studying her watch intently. The radio station plays "Rock Lobster" by the B-52s.

    1. Gloria clenches her teeth, anxiously.

        - GLORIA _anxiously_
            - 15...16...17...

    1. Tommy's eyebrows twitch and a faint murmur escapes his lips.

    1. The shrill sound of a telephone ring cuts in.

        - SFX
            - BEEP-BEEP.  BEEP-BEEP.

    1. A second woman surfaces from beneath the bubbling water, gasping for breath. She is also naked from the waist up.

1. BIG SUR - Record Breaker

    1. Gloria looks happy.

        - GLORIA
            - 17 seconds!
        - TOMMY
            - So close... so close *sigh*

    1. Tommy sighs and reaches for the phone. It is one of those old, large clunky handsets with an aerial. Ivy's face is red, she splutters, still gasping for air.

        - IVY
            - That wasn't fair! The telephone...
        - GLORIA
            - Oh shut it..
        - TOMMY
            - Both of you shut it!

    1. Tommy clambers out of the hot tub with the phone in his hand. We now see that he is still out on the open sea on his yacht. He is still in his garish yellow speedo trunks.

        - TOMMY
            - Yes, speaking. Who is this?

    1. Hundreds of miles up the coast, in an office, a hand twists the wires of a telephone cable nervously. The white sleeves of his coat suggesting some kind of doctor or physician

        - DOC
            - It's me.

    1. Tommy paces across the yacht floor, phone held to his ear. Something is troubling him.

        - TOMMY
            - What's up doc?

1. BIG SUR - Hoist Anchor

    1. He walks towards the two thugs. Vadym is holding up a telescope to his eye looking out to sea. The other man, Matthias, holds a rifle - as if about to take aim at something in the direction of the pointed telescope.

        - TOMMY
            - I see...

    1. Tommy makes a silent 'lets go' gesture to Matthias, whilst still intently listening to the caller on the phone. Matthias has closely-cropped dark hair and a light goatee beard. His hairline is receding. His eyes are dull and lifeless- hinting at a lifetime of substance abuse. He could be anywhere between mid twenty and early forties.

        - MATTHIAS
            - But... what about Jack?

    1. Closeup as Tommy glares daggers at Matthias, giving him no doubt about obeying his order.

    1. View through a telescope. We see Jack Crane perched on his small rock.

    1. Out on the ocean, sat on his small rock, Jack Crane watches the yacht slip away with despair. We see the fin of a shark circling the rock.

1. POLICE DEPT. - Martin & Melissa

    1. View through a window. There is a hand on the window blinds, parting them slightly. Through the gap in the blinds, we see Martin driving up to the nearby curb, Melissa holding onto him tightly on the back of the bike.

    1. Outside the police station, Martin is on his bike parked outside. Melissa wears a helmet. Martin does not. Melissa is clambering off the back of the bike. A large concrete slab on the lawn proclaims: "Santa Cruz Police Department"

    1. Melissa is now off the bike, the helmet in her hands, and looking at Martin

        - MELISSA
            - Thanks for the ride
        - MARTIN
            - Don't mention it. I can't believe Kurt...
        - MELISSA
            - Yeah. He's a real charmer alright.

    1. Martin checks his watch

        - MARTIN
            - Ah crap. I'm late for work my uncle will kill me.
        - MELISSA
            - I guess our date is over then...
        - MARTIN
            - Huh?
        - MELISSA
            - Kidding. Kidding.

    1. Martin scratches his head. Melissa continues to tease him.

        - MELISSA
            - So who are those friends of yours?
        - MARTIN
            - We're in a band. The Lost Boys. We're playing the Blue Lagoon tonight!

    1. Martin smiles proudly and puffs out his chest

        - MELISSA
            - Wow!...that's a terrible name!

    1. Martin now frowns, his ego completely deflated.

    1. Melissa tosses the helmet. Martin catches it.

        - MELISSA
            - Oh, and thanks for this.
            - You drive safely now, lost boy!

    1. Back inside the office, the window blinds remain parted, and the onlooker still there. Melissa walks towards camera (unaware of onlooker), a wry smile on her face. Martin in the background.

1. VALET PARKING - The Note

    1. Daytime. Wide, establishing shot of casino.

    1. Martin is now standing outside the casino entrance, working the valet. He is dressed smartly in shirt and tie. He is deep in concentration and appears to be writing some kind of essay.

    1. Closeup of Martin's face, eyes intently focused on the words in front of him

    1. A car horn sounds. Martin jumps out of his skin, scattering papers everywhere.

        - SFX
            - BEEEEEEP! BEEEEEEEP!

    1. We move to a side view of Martin's position. We see the front of the car. Behind the wheel is a young man with red hair. It's Colin, dressed in similar attire as Martin. He is grinning widely, his hand still honking the horn. Sheets of papers still float around in the air.

        - SFX
            - BEEEEP! BEEEEP! BEEEEP!
        - MARTIN
            - Cut it out, you idiot!

    1. Colin jumps out of the car and begins picking up the pieces of paper.

        - COLIN
            - Ha! You should have seen your face!

    1. Colin now holds a piece of pink paper in his hand.

        - COLIN
            - Hey, what's this?
        - MARTIN
            - Hmm?
        - COLIN
            - It's from Ramona!
        - MARTIN
            - Give it here!

1. VALET PARKING - Gotta Run!

    1. Colin mocks an effeminate face and pose while reading the note, much to Martin's annoyance.

        - COLIN
            - "Dear Martin, coffee and cake at The Perg? 8pm? I'll be waiting for you." - Ramona
            - "p.s. I wont be wearing any underwear"

    1. Closeup of Martin's stunned face.

    1. Colin can't contain himself and bursts out laughing. Martin grabs the note.

        - COLIN
            - Ah-ha-ha, you should see your face! You'll just have to settle for cake, Marty boy.
        - MARTIN
            - Gimme that here!

    1. Martin reads the note and sighs.

        - MARTIN
            - Seriously don't have the time for this. I need a clone.
        - COLIN
            - Hey, if they can clone pigs, I don't see why...
        - MARTIN
            - Can you cover for me for my last hour?
        - COLIN
            - Woahhhhh! Hold on a sec.

    1. Martin looks desperate.

        - MARTIN
            - I'll make it worth your while.
        - COLIN
            - Hey, you know I'm not that kind of guy.
        - MARTIN
            - Very funny.
        - COLIN
            - Okay, okay. But you owe me Marty, boy. You *owe* me!

    1. Martin is already on the move, removing his tie and waistcoat in a hurry as he goes.

        - COLIN
            - Hey Mr Clark Kent, no telephone boxes round here!

1. HOSPITAL - Unusual activity

    1. A bored looking receptionist sits behind her desk, filing her nails almost absent-mindedly. We can now see her name badge, it reads "Carol".

    1. Emily casually strolls up to the desk, holding a paper cup of coffee.

        - CAROL
            - Is she still in there?
        - EMILY
            - M-hm. That's been 2 hours now.

    1. Emily sets down her cup of coffee, her hand still resting on it.

        - CAROL
            - Want me to kick her out?
        - EMILY
            - Nah. What's the point? Not like the poor kid needs any sleep.

    1. Suddenly, an alarm rings out from the wall of monitors behind the reception area. Carol swivels in her chair. Emily spills her coffee over the desk.

        - SFX
            - BLEEP. BLEEP. BLEEP.
        - EMILY
            - Shit.

    1. Carol looks back at Emily, but she is already on the move down the hallway.

        - CAROL
            - Room 3. That's her. Our sleeping beauty!
        - EMILY
            - On my way!

1. HOSPITAL - Sleeping Beauty

    1. Emily pushes open Elizabeth's door.

        - EMILY
            - Excuse me, madam. But can you please...

    1. Emily stands just inside the doorway.

        - EMILY
            - ... leave?

    1. Elizabeth is unmoved, but Kathy is nowhere to be seen. A small transistor radio sits on the seat.

    1. Closeup of radio. Only interference and static.

        - RADIO
            - BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

1. THE BLUE LAGOON - Waiting for the Man

    1. Establishing shot of a grimy, divy bar exterior, punctuated only by the fizzling neon lights that proclaim it be 'The Blue Lagoon'. A bored looking doorman uses a small flashlight to checks the drivers licenses and student ids of the young looking crowd who queue to get in.

    1. Inside, Brian, Alex and Lee are on stage, plugging in equipment, checking mic levels etc. they look like they are playing for time, and the crowd grows restless.

    1. Brian looks anxiously at his large wrap-around wrist watch.

        - BRIAN
            - Where is he for christs sake? It's 9pm already.

    1. The old hippy guy behind the sound desk glares at him impatiently.

    1. Brian holds out his arms and shrugs apologetically.

        - PA SYSTEM
            - You got two minutes, buddy

    1. Over by the wall, two members of the Butchers (the headline act) stand against the wall, arms folded across their chest, faces grim. Clearly they are not impressed. The pressure mounts on Brian.

1. THE BLUE LAGOON - This Sucks

    1. From behind the drum kit, Lee tries to lighten the mood.

        - LEE
            - We can do an instrumental set!
        - ALEX _gruffly_
            - I aint playing any surf music.

    1. Lee sticks her tongue out.

        - LEE
            - Snob!

    1. Brian looks mournful and shakes his head.

        - BRIAN
            - This is a disaster.

    1. A lone heckle comes from the crowd.

        - VOICE IN CROWD
            - You suck.

1. THE PERG - Muffin

    1. Establishing shot. We see an outdoor beer garden with benches and chairs. The place is half full. Mostly youths, sipping coffee and beer whilst chatting or reading a book to themselves in the dimming light.

    1. Closeup of a muffin sitting on table. We see Ramona's elbow resting on the table.

    1. View from behind Ramona, as she leans over the table. Her short, ragged shirt riding up her back. Her face is almost touching Martin's.

    1. Closeup of Martin. Ramona delicately works a fine brush around his eye. Martin's eye's look downward.

        - RAMONA
            - Almost done...

    1. Closeup from Martin's POV, looking directly down Ramona's vest top.

        - RAMONA
            - And quit looking down my top, you pervert.
        - MARTIN
            - I.. I...

1. THE PERG - Makeup

    1. Ramona now sits back to admire her work.

        - RAMONA
            - There! Wow. You look awesome, if I do say so myself.

    1. We now see Martin. He now looks like the Martian love-child of David Bowie and Blondie. His cheeks are still flushed red with embarrassment.

        - MARTIN
            - I was just looking at your... your shoes.
        - RAMONA
            - Oh really? Well, what color are they? *Without* looking.

    1. Martin gulps.

        - MARTIN
            - Black.

    1. Ramona looks surprised.

        - RAMONA
            - Lucky guess! Anyway, we'd better get going. It's 9pm already.

    1. Martin jumps up from the table.

        - MARTIN
            - Whaaaat!? Why didn't you tell me!?
        - RAMONA
            - Calm, down - it's just round the corner!
        - MARTIN
            - Brian is gonna be pissed...

1. THE BLUE LAGOON - Star Power

    1. Brian is still pacing mournfully around the stage.

    1. Out of the crowd, Martin climbs up onto the stage. Brian does not immediately recognize him.

        - BRIAN
            - Hey lady, you can't come up here!

    1. Martin grabs the mic stand and winks at Lee.

    1. Lee grins and takes the cue, beginning an earth-shaking beat on the kick-drum.

    1. Alex, who looks completely stoned, quickly picks up the rhythm, his long, spindly fingers creating bass notes that fill the spaces between Lee's beats.

    1. Brian stands there dumbstruck.

        - BRIAN
            - Dude. What's with the outfit?

    1. Brian shrugs his shoulders with an air of resignation and begins plucking the spiky lead guitar line.

    1. Martin brings the mic to his mouth.

1. THE BLUE LAGOON - Mosh pit

    1. Martin yells out the opening line.

        - MARTIN
            - The drums kick and the drums spit!

    1. Closeup of mosh pit. It seethes and writhes as one. They cheer and go wild in response.

        - MARTIN
            - I see the vodka and the stain on your lips!

    1. Martin throws himself down onto his knees in front of the crowd and lets loose a blood curdling scream. The crowd go insane.

        - MARTIN
            - Aaaaaaaaaaarggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh! The lights reflect those eyes...

    1. Over by the wall, the two members of the Butchers turn their heads and look at each other wide-eyed in unison. The legs of crowd surfers, above heads, can be seen in the foreground.

1. HOSPITAL - The Vanishing

    1. Emily, Carol and a middle-aged male doctor stand by Elizabeth's bedside. The doctor appears flustered, his face red & flushed. His name badge reads, "Dr. J Bartlett". Kathy's coat and handbag are still where she left them.

        - DR J. BARTLETT
            - What do you mean, you didn't see her leave?
        - EMILY
            - Carol was at her desk the whole time. Nobody walked past.
        - CAROL
            - That's right. Nothing. I checked the bathrooms too. She just vanished.
        - DR J. BARTLETT
            - People don't just vanish.

    1. Carol looks concerned.

        - CAROL
            - Is... is Elizabeth going to be okay? I've never seen her like this. Her brain is going haywire. Poor thing.

    1. They all turn and focus their full attention on the stricken young woman.

        - DR J. BARTLETT
            - Carol, did you inform the next of kin?
        - CAROL
            - Yes, yes. He is on his way. He sounded...

    1. Carol pauses. The doctor urges her on.

        - DR J. BARTLETT
            - Yes..?

1. HOSPITAL - Next of Kin

    1. Carol adopts a cynical tone.

        - CAROL
            - Oh, it's probably nothing. But he sounded a bit 'off'.
        - DR J. BARTLETT
            - Well, that's hardly a surprise. I mean, she's gone 10 years and nothing. Nothing at all. He'd probably given up hope.

    1. Emily, the young nurse, chimes in.

        - EMILY
            - Forgotten her, more like.
        - DR J. BARTLETT
            - What do you mean? Have you got something you'd like to share with us Emily?

    1. Emily looks nervous. Wishing she'd never spoke.

        - EMILY
            - Well, he...
        - CAROL
            - Husssshh!

    1. The door swings open. In steps a middle aged man, well dressed in Armani suit and black leather shoes. His hair is slicked back, and large opaque polaroids cover his eyes.

        - TOMMY
            - I hope I'm not disturbing you. Now, I'd like to see my niece.

1. THE BLUE LAGOON - Groupies

    1. A sea of faces in a crowd.

        - MARTIN
            - "The angle of your spine aligns perfectly with mine"

    1. We zoom in close to a familiar face amongst the heaving, sweaty throng of people. It's Melissa.

        - MARTIN
            - "But the markings on your skin, make me think again..."

    1. We see Martin sink to the stage, naked from the waist up and dripping with sweat

        - MARTIN
            - "... about love"

    1. View from behind crowd, their hands aloft in applause.

    1. As the crowd continue to applaud, and the band make their way off the side of the small stage, we see Melissa pushing her way through the crowd towards Martin.

        - MELISSA
            - Martin!

1. THE BLUE LAGOON - Kiss

    1. Melissa pushes her way further through bodies, she is less than 10ft away now. Martin is smiling in her direction.

        - MELISSA
            - Mar..

    1. Suddenly from just a few feet in front of Melissa, Ramona pushes forth out of the crowd, running forward and embracing Martin, planting a big, wet kiss on his lips.

        - RAMONA
            - You were awesome!

    1. Closeup of a crestfallen Melissa. Just behind her we see the two members of the Butchers, still leaning casually against the wall.

    1. Melissa turns away towards the exit.

        - BUTCHER #1
            - Excuse me miss. Can I borrow your eye-liner?

    1. Melissa ignores him. She seemingly can't leave quick enough.

        - BUTCHER #2
            - Lame, dude. Very lame.

1. THE BASEMENT - The Sound of Music

    1. A closeup of the inside of a porta-cabin door. On one side of the door, taped to the wall are several photographs. A young girl, around ten years old - standing in a grassy backyard, pointing a water pistol at the camera. A picture of a boy and the same girl, dressed as Mexican troubadours posing for the photo with wide gap-toothed grins. A faded, sun-bleached photo, torn in half. The remaining half showing a dazzlingly beautiful lady with blonde hair, smiling blissfully as she sits by the beach in a deck chair. Her clothes date the photo to late 70s or early 80s.

    1. Closeup of door handle. A key turns in the lock

        - SFX
            - Click!

    1. The door swings open. Martin stands there, looking weary. His face still made up. It is pitch black behind him outside the room.

    1. He stumbles inside and slumps down on his bed.

        - MARTIN _to himself_
            - What a day. What a night! I'm beat.

    1. View from above bed. Martin lies there staring upward at the ceiling. Adrenaline still pumps through him. He is wide eyed. His head throbs. His veins pulse.

        - MARTIN
            - Ah man. I can still hear music.

    1. A puzzled look crosses his face.

        - MARTIN
            - Wait a minute... I *do* hear music.

    1. He clambers up off the bed and walks back towards the door.

    1. As he nears the door we see a closeup of his hand grabbing a flashlight off the nearby shelf.

1. THE BASEMENT - Bump in the Night

    1. In the parking garage now. In the foreground, by a wall, looms some large rectangular shaped object covered by tarpaulin. A few pieces of broken machinery lie scattered across the floor near the wall. Martin's flashlight beam can be seen ahead in the distance, sweeping from side to side. Music plays loudly.

        > Music todo

        - MARTIN
            - Hello? Anybody there?

    1. Martin's face. Ghostly pale in the blackness around him. Only faintly lit by the glare of the flashlight.

        > Music todo

        - MARTIN
            - Hey, Colin. This better not be some stupid prank, man.

    1. Martin is startled by a sudden noise. He swings his flashlight over to one side. We see him from the waist up, side on. Darkness behind him. His face more concerned now.

        > Music todo

        - SFX
            - Thud!
        - MARTIN
            - Huh!?

    1. Same view as before, with the tarpaulin covered object lurking in the foreground. This time Martin is much closer and his flashlight points straight towards the mysterious object.

        > Music todo

        - SFX _coming from object_
            - Bump! Bump! Thud!

    1. Martin's hand grips the edge of the tarpaulin.

    1. He tugs the tarpaulin half way off, it looks like a large metal box of some kind.

    1. The tarpaulin lands in a heap by side of object. We see the edge of the metal box.

    1. Martin looks down at the object, his face full of distant, somber emotion.

1. THE BASEMENT - Jukebox

    1. Martin stands in front of an old metal jukebox. It is blackened with fire damage and the glass is shattered.

    1. Another thud comes from the jukebox. But Martin stands rooted to the spot, as if locked in a trance.

        - SFX
            - Thud

    1. Inside the jukebox, resting on the remains of the spindle, is a cracked vinyl disc. An old Elvis 45.

    1. One more thud breaks him of his stupor.

        - SFX
            - Thud!

    1. Martin crouches down and begins prying open the back panel of the jukebox.

    1. Closeup as the panel pops open.

        - SFX
            - CLICK!

    1. Martin points his flashlight into the darkness inside. Something small inside reflects the light back at him.

    1. Then a flutter of wings and feathers, a raven emerges from the dark hole, squawking loudly. It flies directly at Martin, forcing him to duck out of the way.

        - RAVEN
            - Squawk! Squawk!
        - MARTIN
            - Arrrgghh!

1. THE BASEMENT - Raven

    1. When Martin looks around, the raven is gone.

        - MARTIN
            - What the...!?

    1. Martin now returns his attention to the panel, intrigued by whatever else may lie inside.

    1. Closeup of Martin's hand reaching into the hole.

    1. Martin has withdrawn his hand from the innards of the old machine, and holds his hand up to his face to inspect his find.

    1. In his hand are spent bullet casings.

    1. Martin rises from his knees, and leans over the machine. A puzzled expression on his face.

1. THE BASEMENT - Ghost

    1. View from behind Martin as he still stands, leaning forward against the jukebox. The apparition of a young girl stands beside him. Her form is ethereal; ghost-like.

    1. We see the two figures standing side-by-side, pressed against a now pristine and reconstructed jukebox.

        - ELIZABETH
            - Hi Martin.

    1. Martin looks down his eyes wide with fright.

        - MARTIN
            - Ah man. I shouldn't have ate that muffin.


<!--

1. As we zoom out, we see not only the jukebox has been reconstructed, but the entire walls and interior are like new. They stand in a diner. It is a view that solemnly mirrors that from the prologue. Over by a counter, a blonde haired waitress serves coffee for two old men in flannels shirts. Martin gawps around in amazement. -->
