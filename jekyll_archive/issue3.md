1. THE WRESTLER - Sweat

    1. In a dimly lit corner of the parking garage basement we see a wrestling ring. The fluorescent overheads lights flicker, creating long wide shadows of the ropes across the parking lot floor. Inside the ring, a large bulky man appears to be warming up, bouncing himself between the ropes.

    1. Closeup as the man propels himself back off the ropes. It's Vadym. Sweat flies off him. Vadym grimaces. He looks old and a little out of shape. His spandex leggings have seen better days.

    1. He charges across the canvas towards the ropes.

    1. But instead of turning his back into the ropes, this time he slows his pace and holds up his arms to catch the top rope.

    1. Vadym leans over, holding the ropes. He is panting for breath and clearly exhausted. Sweat drip from his forehead and splats on the canvas below.

    1. Vadym takes a long swig from a water bottle and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand

        - VADYM
            - I'm too old for this shit.

1. THE WRESTLER - Sparring

    1. Vadym throws his towel and water bottle over the side of the ring.

    1. Vadym puts one leg through the ropes, as if about to leave.

        - VOICE
            - Not so fast.

    1. Vadym looks around, startled.

        - VADYM
            - Huh? Who said that?

    1. The lights flicker. Vadym plants his foot back down into the ring, and puffs his chest out menacingly.

        - VADYM
            - Show yourself.

    1. Only a chilling laugh in response. Vadym is less sure of himself now.

        - VOICE _laughing_
            - Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha.
        - VADYM
            - Matthias? Is that you? Quit fooling around.

    1. Something, or someone, grabs his arm - pulling it out wide to his body.

        - VADYM
            - Hm?

    1. Vadym hurtles across the canvas, propelled by some unseen force. As he nears the ropes, the force releases his arm.

        - VADYM
            - Shit!

1. THE WRESTLER - Smackdown

    1. He smashes into the ropes. The ropes take his weight, absorbing the energy, and thrust him back out into the ring.

    1. He is travelling fast, off balance - almost tripping forwards over his own feet.

    1. The unseen force, lurking in shadow, takes hold off him again, throwing him forward with terrible momentum.

        - VADYM
            - Shit.

    1. He slams into the ropes once more, but the force this time is too much, his body shape all wrong.

    1. The ropes wrap around his neck, twisting his head grotesquely.

    1. Vadym lets out a deathly wheeze, and his eyes loll back in his head. Life slips from his body.

1. BASEMENT - Rise &amp; Shine

    1. Martin wakes up in his bed, soaked with perspiration.

    1. His eyes are wide with fright.

1. BACKSTORY - Good old Days

    1. A young looking Tommy has his hands on the wheel of a convertible. The car winds it's way along a valley road, past orchards and fields. In the passenger seat is Jean. Her blonde hair wild in the wind. With their dark shades, the two of them together look like movie-stars. Or Bonnie & Clyde.

        > "Tommy and your mother were childhood sweethearts you know. Oh they were inseparable"

    1. Sitting in the back of the same car, we see Jeff and Kathy. Although Kathy is beautiful and Jeff has his own rugged good looks, they couldn't be more different from the glamour of Tommy & Jean.

        > "We were inseparable. All four of us, that summer."

    1. View from side of car

        > "Those were good times. I miss those days."

    1. Profile view of Jean in passenger seat of car

        > "But poor Jeff. He was head over heels with Jean"

    1. Closeup of Jeff, sitting behind the driver's seat, gazing across at Jean's profile

        > "At times he couldn't stand to see her with him."

    1. Jean turns her head and smiles at Jeff

        > "Sometimes I think she enjoyed the attention"

    1. Closeup of Tommy glancing up at the rear-view mirror. He adjusts the mirror slightly with his hand. A sneer on his face.

        > "But Tommy was always watching her closely. Like a snake."

1. BACKSTORY - Rebound

    1. Kathy and Jean sit on a bed. Jean weeps profusely, her head buried in Kathy's shoulder and comforting embrace.

        > "One day, Tommy upped and left. Just like that. Not a sign, not a trace."

    1. Closeup of Jean's blackened eye, her head still resting on the shoulder of Kathy

        > "He'd roughed her up pretty badly. It wasn't the first time. He could be a real piece of shit."

    1. Closeup of finger pressing the outside button of a doorbell.

    1. Jean is sitting on the sofa reading a book. She is huddled under a blanket. Her eye now much less black & swollen.

        - SFX
            - Ding! Dong!

    1. Close up of Jean's hand turning the door handle

    1. The door is now open and we see Jeff standing on the outside step. A bunch of flowers gripped tightly, nervously in his hand by his side. A shy, hopeful look etched across his face.

        > "Once it became clear Tommy wasn't coming back, Jeff made his move. Let's just say he didn't waste any time!"

1. BACKSTORY - Marriage

    1. Inside a small chapel, Jeff & Jean kiss as they exchange rings in their wedding ceremony.

        > "To him it was simple. Jean was the girl of his dreams, and now his brother was out of the picture."

    1. Jeff & Jean stand outside the old run-down diner up on summit. Their estate agent in close attendance, clutching a clipboard jammed with paperwork.

        > "Jeff was full of dreams and idealism. They took out a loan and bought the old diner up on Summit."

    1. Jeff & Jean kissing and embracing. The agent looking on with a warm hearted smile over his horn-rimmed spectacles.

        > "The place was run down. Had been for years."

    1. View of Jeff atop a step ladder, hammer in hand, knocking a nail into a new signpost, it reads "The Chapman Diner". The diner is now re-furbished and looks open for business. Jean stands below, gazing upwards, one hand resting on her swollen belly, one hand over eyes protecting them from the glare of the sun.

        > "But Jeff worked on that place every day and night for months"

    1. Jean lies in a hospital bed, in the latter stages of labour and now pushing hard. Jeff smoothes her hair with his hand - his face a picture of utmost concern.

        > "And then of course you two came along. So perfect, like little mirror images of each other. A miracle. Two miracles!"

    1. Jean lying in bed, a sweaty, exhausted mess. She cradles the two twins in her arms.

        > "The perfect family"

1. BACKSTORY - Prodigal Son

    1. Jean stands outside the front doors of the mountain diner, hands on hips, looking out to the distance.

        > "And that's the way it stayed for years. Oh of course your mother and father had their ups and downs. The diner never really took off the way they wanted it to. Jean felt the strain. Four mouths to feed wasn't easy. But I always thought they were happy, more or less."

    1. A long convoy of construction trucks drive into the large area of wasteland by the diner.

        > "Then one day, guess who shows up out of nowhere?"

    1. A man climbs down from the passenger side of one of the trucks. His hair is slicked back, he wears a smart, navy suit, in one hand is a hard hat.

        > "Yup, you guessed it...Tommy"

    1. View from behind Tommy, his hand on his hips as he surveys the land around him.

        > "He'd been gone over ten years. Lost all contact with us, save for the odd postcard from Reno or Las Vegas or the like. He never wrote anything on them."

    1. On a flickering tv monitor, we see Jean sitting by Elizabeth's bedside, she stubs out her cigarette in a coffee cup, almost absent mindedly.

        - JEAN
            - I think he was just letting us know he was still out there. Still alive.

1. THE MORGUE - John Doe

    1. Inside the city morgue, Greig McDonald, Melissa Jenkins & Kurt King look down upon a body wrapped up in plastic.

        - GREIG
            - Fresh catch of the day!

    1. Melissa looks at Greig, appalled by his sense of humour.

        - MELISSA
            - This man might be somebody's father. Have some decency, will you?
        - GREIG
            - Ah yes, excuse me, I'm sorry lassie. Gotta have a sense of humour you know.

    1. Kurt is as cold and bleak as ever.

        - KURT
            - Where did you fish him out?

    1. We flashback to a scene of the cadavar floating face down and naked in the ocean.

        - GREIG
            - Half-way down Big Sur. Washed up in some rock pool. We reckon he's a vagrant. Still waiting on an ID, but it could take a while. Nothings come up in the system yet.
        - MELISSA
            - How would a vagrant get half-way down Big Sur without a ride?

   1. Close of Greig's wry, almost sympathetic smile.

        - GREIG
            - You're definitely not from round here, are you?

1. BACKSTORY - Gala

    1. Jean sits by Elizabeth's bedside, stroking the young woman's hair tenderly.

        - JEAN
            - I know you can hear me in there. I just know you can. My poor love. Now, where was I?

    1. Inside a large banquet hall, hundreds of finely dressed ladies and gentlemen sit around large round tables, feasting on fine food and drinking champagne whilst a jazz band plays on the large stage at the center of the room.

        > "Oh yes. The return of Tommy. The return of the prodigal son! He'd made a lot of money. He was mixing it up with the high life"

    1. Closeup of Tommy, dressed in tuxedo. He sits at one of the more expensive tables, closest to the stage. His hands are raised, applauding the performers with bravado. A large smile on his face.

        > "He always had the charisma to get whatever he wanted, and now he had the money too"

    1. Over by the doorway we see a young Jack Crane. Seemingly even smaller and daintier in his younger age. He leans against door frame, keeping a hawkish eye on the activities of Tommy's table.

        > "But where ever Tommy went, he always attracted attention. Not all of it good."

    1. A young table attendant delivers an envelope to Tommy at his table. He gives it an inquisitive glance.

        > "There were other, let's say 'undesirable elements' of the community that wanted their fingers in his pie"

1. BACKSTORY - Costly Mistake

    1. Up on summit, tall cranes, bulldozers and diggers dominate the scene. The foundations of the new casino are in place and construction is well underway.

        > "He could have built that casino anywhere he wanted. Any town in California, any state in America, any country in the world."

    1. On the building site, inside a trailer, several men stand at a table, surveying the maps and blueprints scattered across it's surface. We don't see their faces.

        > "But it was like he had some vendetta to settle with us. Um, your parents I mean."

    1. On a paper map, we see a finger pointing at the location of the Chapman Diner. On the map can also be seen the plot of land set aside for the casino. The other side of the road is marked as "Ohlone Burial Ground". Everywhere else is mountainside or redwoods.

        > "Well, anyway - things moved quickly. Too quickly as it turned out."

    1. Closeup of construction manager, raising the front of his hard hat with one hand and rubbing the other hand through his hair nervously. Jack Crane stands next to him with a menacing air.

        > "The boundaries of the diner extended way further than they imagined, taking up a key piece of land"

    1. Tommy bangs his fist down on the table angrily

        > "It was too late to back out now. The stakes were too high."

    1. In a quiet, secluded stretch of the San Lorenzo River, the lifeless body of the construction manager floats faces up, bobbing up and down gently in the slow moving current.

1. BACKSTORY - Family Ties

    1. Jeff, Jean & Tommy stand in the diner's kitchen. They look to be exchanged in a heated conversation. Tommy holds a sheaf of papers outstretched in one hand and a pen in the other.

        > "Tommy did the only thing he could do. He offered to buy the old diner."

    1. Jeff turns away, his body language defiant, as he refuses to sign the papers. Jean has her arms thrown up, in a pleading motion to her husband.

        > "Jean saw this as a way out of their financial troubles, but Jeff was a proud man. Maybe too proud. He wasn't going to sell. He wasn't going to give up his dream."

    1. Tommy points his finger directly at his brother, in a threatening gesture.

        > "They said things to each other that day like all brothers do. Silly things. Shouting and screaming. They let it all out. Threatening each other and this and that."

    1. Tommy storms out of the diner, slamming the door behind him, so hard that it bounces back of it's hinges.

        > "Old wounds were reopened. And never closed."

    1. Jean sits in a booth, sobbing to herself.

        > "And a wedge was driven between Jeff and Jean that night."

    1. Jeff walks over to Jean, arms outstretched in an effort to comfort her.

    1. But Jean flees out of the door. Jeff makes no effort to follow her.

        > "Life can change so quickly..."

    1. Kathy still sits beside the prone Elizabeth, she snaps her fingers together in the air.

        > "...just like that."

        - KATHY _clicking fingers_
            - Snap!

1. BACKSTORY - Roughed-up

    1. The diner car park is deserted except for Jeff's truck and a lone, white van - almost cloaked by the pre-dawn mist. The shapes of two bulky men can be seen sitting up front in the van.

        > "If only Tommy hadn't got mixed up in things beyond his control. I'm sure everything could have been sorted out."

    1. Jeff stands at the front doors, opening up for the day's business.

        > "But it was no longer just a family matter."

    1. The two men approach Jeff from behind, startling him.

        > "The next day Jeff received a message."

    1. Jeff receives a powerful blow to his midriff, knocking the wind out of him.

        > "I pleaded and pleaded with your father to give in. Thankfully, he was proud but he wasn't stupid. He wouldn't put his family at risk."

    1. Jeff is doubled over, unable to defend himself, and receives a meaty fist to the side of his head, knocking him cold.

        > "He was down, bruised and utterly defeated. I felt so awful. I... I wish I could have done more for him"

    1. Jeff lies sprawled on the pavement. The two men loom over him, menacingly.

        > "I often think about that."

    1. Closeup of Jeff on the ground, as the two men walk away in the direction of their van.

        > "They'd roughed him up pretty bad - but it was just a warning."

    1. On a flickering monitor is the video camera playback of Elizabeth's ward. Kathy still sit close to Elizabeth, their hands clasped.

    1. On the monitor, Kathy rises

        - KATHY
            - Oh damn. Where did I put that extra pack?
            - Excuse me dear, while I go and hunt down more cancer sticks.
            - They can't hurt me now, right?



1. THE CHAPEL - Sunday Service

    1. A narrow wooden church, with steep angular sides, lies nestled in the redwoods - set back about 100 yards from the side of the road - imperceptible to most passerbys. It has no gates and not even a front door.

    1. A vintage, convertible sports car pulls into the driveway. Behind the wheel is Tommy, sharply dressed in italian wool suit. A thick scarf and leather gloves protect him from the morning chill.

    1. A closed circuit security camera, placed high up in the trees, swivels onto Tommy's location.

    1. Through a black and white security monitor, we see Tommy stepping out of his car, removing his gloves as he does so.

    1. Tommy, out of his car now, approaches the open doorway. He looks casual and relaxed, a newspaper carried in one hand.

    1. On a second screen we see Tommy walking towards the camera and into the building.

        - SECURITY GUARD
            - Tommy heading your way. Over.

    1. A man sits on a simple, nondescript wooden chair. He is dressed in plain medieval looking clothes - brown trousers, black pointed boots and loose white shirt. A strange witch like hat rests on his head from out of which twists long, knotted hair. It is difficult to tell where his hair ends and his beard begins. Beside him stand two rakish young girls, all dressed in long flowing white. Their long, unkempt hair obscuring their faces. They are maybe 17 or 18 years old.

1. THE CHAPEL - Water

    1. The man known as Fernandez twists his beard absently.

        - FERNANDEZ
            - Good morning. I pray you are here to pay your respects to our dear departed friend?

    1. Tommy tosses the newspaper over to Fernandez

        - TOMMY
            - Indeed I am.

    1. Closeup of one of the girls. Her eyes look dead, like empty husks. A walking corpse.

    1. Tommy lights up a cigarette

    1. Fernandez holds the newspaper before him in a casual manner, his eyebrows raised.

        - FERNANDEZ
            - The Koran tells us that from water comes all life. The fetus grows within the amniotic fluid, and we all begin our existence within the seemingly endless sea.

    1. Closeup of newspaper. A small article reads "Naked corpse found in sea. Police as yet unable to identify the body"

        - FERNANDEZ
            - But water will always threaten to swallow what it creates.

    1. Closeup of Fernandez

        - FERNANDEZ
            - Tell me Tommy. What is it about you and leaving people to die? It's becoming something of a motif, is it not?

    1. But Tommy is already making his way towards the exit. His face stern. Behind him Fernandez has put down the paper and is stroking the hair of one of the girls, almost like she were a cat. A smirk resides on his face.

1. THE CHAPEL - Tommy's Displeasure

    1. Tommy storms out of the chapel. His face like stone.

    1. A second car is now parked beside Tommy's. The driver side door is open. Matthias stands to attention beside it. He looks nervous and sheepish, not knowing where to put his hands.

        - TOMMY
            - Nice of you to show up.
        - MATTHIAS
            - Umm... thanks boss.

    1. Tommy gets up close to Matthias. Matthias scratches his head, unsure how to respond.

        - TOMMY
            - I was being sarcastic, you moron. Remind me, what exactly do I pay you for?
        - MATTHIAS
            - Errr....

    1. Matthias scratches his head.

        - TOMMY
            - Let me tell you. It's not for your brains. Or your sparkling conversation?

    1. Tommy jabs a finger into Matthias' chest. Matthias is clearly the bigger, more physically intimidating of the two, but he flinches away from Tommy with real fear.

        - TOMMY
            - I pay you to watch my back. That's all.
        - MATTHIAS
            - Sorry, boss. But...

    1. Tommy strides away to his car. Turning his back to the hapless Matthias.

        - TOMMY
            - No buts. And where is the rest of my 'protection'?
        - MATTHIAS
            - Um... that's what I was trying to tell you boss... he didn't show up this morning.

1. HOSPITAL -  Surveillance

    1. Inside the hospital security office. Carol and Emily sit in silence. On the monitor, the video is paused at the point where Kathy left Elizabeth's room. A security guard sits beside them, his hands on the mouse and keyboard.

    1. Emily places her hand on the guards shoulder.

        - EMILY
            - Thanks Max, we can turn it off now.

    1. Carol turns to Emily, as Max begins operating the controls. The tv monitors skip from room to room.

        - CAROL
            - We should tell somebody about this.

    1. Emily looks unsure. The tv monitors show an empty hallway.

        - EMILY
            - Are you kidding!? I don't trust that man.

    1. Max has paused the surveillance. A woman enters the hallway. It appears to be Kathy.

        - MAX
            - Hmm, you might want to see this.
